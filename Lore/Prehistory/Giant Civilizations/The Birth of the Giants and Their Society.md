Expanding on the birth of the Giants and the establishment of their society reveals a period of awe-inspiring achievements and profound disparities. The Giants, as the offspring of humans and their supernatural patrons, possessed an array of formidable powers that set them apart from their human kin. Their rise to power marked the beginning of an era that would be forever etched into the annals of history, characterized by both grandeur and oppression.

### Emergence of the Giants

- **Origins**: The Giants were born from the union of humans and either Menhir or Idols, inheriting the physical prowess and mystical abilities of their non-human parents. These traits included superhuman strength, longevity, and the innate ability to manipulate magical forces.
- **Early Years**: Initially, the Giants lived among humans as equals, albeit with noticeable differences in abilities and lifespan. However, as they grew in number and power, they began to see themselves as superior to their fully human counterparts. This belief was often encouraged by the Idols and Menhir, who saw in their offspring the potential to dominate and reshape the world.

### Establishment of Their Societies

- **Formation of the First Cities**: Drawing on their divine heritage, the Giants founded the first great cities. Using both their innate abilities and the labor of human subjects, they erected towering structures that reached towards the heavens, showcasing their power and ambition. These cities were centers of magic and learning, where the Giants experimented with their abilities and delved into the mysteries of the universe.
- **Societal Structure**: The society of the Giants was hierarchical, with the most powerful among them ruling as god-kings over vast territories. These rulers were often worshiped as deities by their human subjects, who attributed natural phenomena and the success of their crops to the whims of their giant overlords.
- **The Role of Humans**: Humans were largely subservient in this society, valued for their labor and, occasionally, their magical potential. Some humans were elevated to positions of relative power, serving as priests, magicians, or advisors, but they remained fundamentally beneath the Giants in the social order.

### Cultural and Architectural Achievements

- **Architectural Marvels**: The cities of the Giants were marvels of ancient architecture, featuring grand palaces, temples, and public spaces. Magic was integrated into their construction, with buildings that defied natural laws and gardens that flourished in defiance of the surrounding environment.
- **Art and Literature**: The Giants and their human subjects created a rich tapestry of art and literature, much of it dedicated to the glorification of the Giants themselves. Epic poems told of their deeds and battles, while statues and frescoes depicted them as godlike figures dominating the natural world.

### Governance and Bureaucracy

- **Rule by Decree and Magic**: The Giants governed their domains with a combination of divine decree and magical prowess. Laws were often arbitrary and enforced through magical means, ensuring compliance through fear or enchantment.
- **Complex Bureaucracies**: Despite their authoritarian rule, the societies of the Giants developed complex bureaucracies to manage the day-to-day affairs of their cities and the allocation of resources. These systems were designed to maintain the Giants' control over their domains and to manage the contributions (and punishments) of their human subjects.

### Conclusion

The era of the Giants was one of stark contrasts: incredible achievements in architecture, art, and magic stood alongside brutal regimes of control and subjugation. The Giants' rule left an indelible mark on the world, their cities and creations becoming the stuff of legend. However, their society also sowed the seeds of its own downfall, as the oppressed humans and the ambitions of the Giants themselves led to internal strife and eventual civil war. This period serves as a cautionary tale of the dangers of unchecked power and the inherent instability of a society built on inequality and fear.
