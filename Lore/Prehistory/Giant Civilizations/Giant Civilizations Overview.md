- **Core Traits**: Obsessed with wealth and material accumulation, showcasing monumental treasuries and temples dedicated to their endless pursuit of riches.
- **Society**: Ruled by Giants born of "The Avarice," humans served as slaves, toiling to amass wealth for their overlords, under the threat of severe punishment for failure.
- **Magical Influence**: Enchantment of objects and spaces to trap both divine beings and humans in a web of greed, with the power to lure and corrupt further followers.

### 2. [[The Infernal Conquerors]]: Children of "The Fury"

- **Core Traits**: Militaristic and expansionist, thriving on conquest, warfare, and the spectacle of sacrifice in arenas and temples of flame.
- **Society**: A caste system based on prowess in battle, with humans primarily serving as captives for sacrifice or slaves for the war machine.
- **Magical Influence**: Empowered by "The Fury" to dominate through strength and wrath, wielding fire and destruction as both weapon and worship.

### 3. [[The Celestial Harmony]]: Dominion of the Star-born Tyrants

- **Core Traits**: Governed by a rigid caste system under the guise of maintaining cosmic balance, with elaborate rituals and sacrifices to mirror celestial events.
- **Society**: Giants as divine rulers enforcing a merciless order, with humans relegated to the lowest echelons, their fates sealed by birth.
- **Magical Influence**: Utilization of astral and celestial magic for control and divination, demanding human sacrifices to appease the cosmic entities.

### 4. [[The Hanging Gardens of the Fae]]: Realm of the Earthbound Despots

- **Core Traits**: Masters of geomancy and nature magic, creating paradises that demand relentless human labor under threat of dire punishment.
- **Society**: An opulent, yet cruel, society where the Giants indulge in excess, enforcing their will through a complex legal and bureaucratic system.
- **Magical Influence**: Geomantic manipulation of the land for beauty and control, with enchantments that imprison and compel obedience.

### 5. [[The Imperial Court of the Sovereign]]: Progeny of "The Sovereign"

- **Core Traits**: Ruled by an unyielding belief in their divine right, underpinned by pride and the desire for absolute control, mirroring the grandeur and complexity of ancient Chinese dynasties with a dark, prideful twist.
- **Society**: Governed by a series of dynastic rulers who believed in their superiority and divine mandate, leading to a highly stratified society with Giants at the top and humans serving as subjects, soldiers, or pawns in their grand designs. The civilization was marked by periods of civil strife, with warlords engaging in bloody conflicts for power, reflecting the Idol of Pride's influence on their governance and interpersonal relations.
- **Magical Influence**: Utilized advanced geomancy and manipulation magic to erect monumental architecture and enforce isolationist policies, creating a realm of splendor that was both a testament to their power and a prison of their own hubris. Vampirism originated within this civilization, a direct consequence of the diluted giant blood, imbuing select humans with dark gifts that echoed the pride and solitude of their progenitors.

Each of these civilizations reflects the diverse yet uniformly oppressive ways in which the Giants, influenced by their divine progenitors, ruled over humanity. Their legacies, marked by architectural and magical marvels as well as by the suffering and resistance of the enslaved humans, remain etched into the world's history as a testament to the enduring struggle between tyranny and the quest for freedom.
