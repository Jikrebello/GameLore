Exploring the prehistory of humanity under the rule of the Giants in the lands north of the Great Glass Desert offers a fascinating glimpse into a time of myth, magic, and tyranny. This era, shrouded in the mists of legend, can be divided into key historical moments, each contributing to the rich tapestry of your world's lore.

### [[Life Immediately After the Fall]]

- **The Shattering of Eden**: Following humanity's expulsion from Eden, the world was a chaotic and unforgiving place. The remnants of paradise lingered, but its magic was twisted, its beauty marred by the consequences of the Fall. Humans, now mortal and vulnerable, struggled to survive in a world that was no longer their sanctuary.
- **The Arrival of the Menhir and Idols**: As humanity reeled from their loss, the Menhir and Idols began to walk among them. These beings, drawn to the remnants of Eden's magic and the potential of humanity, offered their knowledge, protection, and sometimes deception. In these early days, humans looked to these entities as guides, protectors, or even deities, learning to harness the land's magic, agriculture, and the basics of civilization.

### [[The Birth of the Giants and Their Society]]

- **Fraternization and Offspring**: The unions between humans and their supernatural benefactors gave rise to the Giantsâ€”beings of immense power, strength, and intellect, who inherited aspects of both their earthly and celestial progenitors. These demigods naturally rose to positions of power, using their abilities to shape the world around them and the societies in which they lived.
- **Demi-God King Pharaohs**: Inspired by Mesopotamian and ancient Egyptian societies, the Giants established their dominion over humanity, ruling as god-kings within monumental cities of stone and magic. They demanded worship, tribute, and labor from humans, who they saw as lesser beings. These societies were marked by incredible architectural achievements, complex bureaucracies, and a rigid social hierarchy, with the Giants at its apex.

### [[Society of the Giants]]

- **Magical and Architectural Marvels**: The Giants' cities were wonders of the ancient world, with towering structures, enchanted gardens, and formidable defenses. Magic was integral to their society, used not only for construction and warfare but also to enforce their rule over humans and the natural world.
- **Cultural Achievements**: Despite their tyranny, the era of the Giants was also a time of significant cultural and intellectual advancement. Humans learned advanced agriculture, metallurgy, writing, and the arts under their rule, albeit often for the Giants' benefit.

### [[The Civil War Among the Giants]]

- **Divine Intervention**: The civil war among the Giants was not merely a political struggle but also a spiritual one, as the Lord's use of the Great Prophet as a vessel to free humanity intensified the conflict. Divine plagues, miraculous events, and the empowerment of human rebels added a celestial dimension to the war, making it not just a battle for supremacy but a fight for the soul of the world.
- **Natural and Unnatural Disasters**: The conflict was marked by disasters both natural and magical, as the Giants' warfare wreaked havoc on the environment. Earthquakes, storms, and arcane anomalies devastated the land, making life even more precarious for the humans caught in the crossfire.
- **Slave Rebellions and Guerrilla Warfare**: Amid the chaos, human slaves seized the opportunity to revolt, forming guerrilla factions that struck at weakened Giant outposts and caravans. These uprisings, though disparate and initially uncoordinated, gradually coalesced into a more organized resistance, fueled by the hope of liberation and the tactical use of stolen magic and weapons.

### [[Aftermath and Speculation]]

- **A World in Ruins**: The aftermath of the civil war left the northern lands scarred and transformed. Vast regions became uninhabitable wastelands, poisoned by magic and littered with the detritus of war. These areas, known as the Blighted Zones, are home to twisted creatures and haunted by the spectral remnants of fallen Giants and humans alike.
- **Survivors and New Civilizations**: The humans who remained, or those unable to follow the Great Prophet's exodus, found themselves in a post-apocalyptic landscape. They scavenged the ruins for knowledge, resources, and magic, gradually forming new societies that were a shadow of the Giants' grandeur. These communities were isolated and often superstitious, their cultures shaped by the need to survive in a world filled with dangers both mundane and magical.
- **The Giants' Diminished Legacy**: The surviving Giants, stripped of their dominion and much of their power, faded into obscurity. Some became reclusive, hiding in the few sanctuaries left untouched by war. Others were hunted down by vengeful humans or ambitious peers. The once-mighty beings became subjects of myth and legend, their true history mingled with tales of gods, monsters, and heroes.

### [[Legacy of the Giants]]

- **Ruins as Tombs and Treasures**: The colossal ruins of the Giants' cities serve as both tombs for a bygone era and troves of forgotten knowledge. Adventurers and scholars brave the dangers of the Blighted Zones to uncover artifacts and lore that could unlock the secrets of the past or the power to shape the future.
- **Cultural Memory and Myth**: The stories of the Giants and their empire, though warped by time and trauma, continue to influence the cultures that emerged from their shadow. They serve as cautionary tales, reminders of the hubris that led to their downfall, and as symbols of the indomitable will of humanity to persevere and reclaim their world.
