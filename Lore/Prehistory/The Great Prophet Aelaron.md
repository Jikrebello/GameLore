In the annals of our world's history, few names resonate as profoundly as that of Prophet Aelaron, the Liberator. Chosen by The Lord amidst ominous signs and wonders, Aelaron was tasked with a mission of unparalleled significance: to free humanity from the clutches of the Giants and lead them to a promised land of freedom and divine favor.

### Prophet Aelaron: The Liberator and Lawgiver

**Divine Mandate**: The heavens themselves heralded Aelaron's selection, with celestial phenomena that spoke of The Lord's direct intervention. Despite initial hesitance, Aelaron's deep faith and unwavering spirit compelled him to embrace his role as the divine emissary, destined to challenge the tyranny of the Giants.

**Exodus from the North**: Armed with divine authority, Aelaron confronted the Giants, demanding the release of his people. What followed was a series of miraculous events that shattered the Giants' dominion—plagues that weakened their grip and internal strife that mirrored the ancient conflicts foretold in the legends of Enoch. Under Aelaron's guidance, humanity embarked on a perilous journey through the Great Glass Desert, a testament to their resilience and faith, guided by the miracles that sustained them through hardships unimaginable.

### The Covenant and Divine Script

**The Sacred Law**: Upon a sacred mountain, in a moment of solitude with The Lord, Aelaron received the Law—a divine covenant outlining the moral, spiritual, and social framework meant to guide humanity. Yet, upon witnessing his people's falter in faith, Aelaron, in a moment of divine fury, shattered the tablets of the Law, a symbolic act underscoring the fragile relationship between the divine and the human.

**Miraculous Script**: Alongside the Law, Aelaron was bestowed with the knowledge of a divine script, capable of invoking the lesser miracles of The Lord. This sacred language, a gift of profound power, became a cornerstone for healing, protection, and divine warfare, cherished and guarded through the ages.

### The Unfinished Legacy

**Contention and Schism**: The Law, though foundational, was left incomplete. The gaps within its commandments became the seeds of division among Aelaron's followers, laying the groundwork for the eventual emergence of the Sancta Confoederatio and the Ahl-e-Ahd, each claiming to fulfill the covenant in their own right.

**The Prophet's Disappearance**: As the promised lands of the south loomed on the horizon, Aelaron vanished. The circumstances of his departure are steeped in mystery—some claim he ascended, taken by The Lord to continue his divine mission elsewhere, while others whisper of a more mortal end. His fate remains a subject of fervent debate and speculation, a puzzle that fuels the faith and curiosity of generations.

### Conclusion

Prophet Aelaron's legacy is a beacon of light and a source of endless debate. His life, marked by divine intervention, miraculous deeds, and the eternal quest for freedom and righteousness, continues to inspire and divide the faithful. In the tapestry of our world's history, Aelaron stands as a monumental figure, a bridge between the divine and the mortal, whose teachings, however incomplete, guide the hearts and souls of all who seek The Lord's grace.
