### The Jirahar Caravans: Land and Water Forms

#### Land Form: The Terrochar
- **Description:** In their land form, known as the Terrochar (from "Terra," meaning land, and "Char," short for chariot), these caravans are robust, all-terrain vehicles. They are expertly crafted with durable materials and designed for long journeys across diverse landscapes.
- **Features:** The Terrochar includes retractable wheels, storage compartments for supplies, and living spaces that are both compact and comfortable. The design also allows for quick transformation into watercraft.

#### Water Form: The Aquanave
- **Description:** When transformed into watercraft, they are called the Aquanave (combining "Aqua," meaning water, and "Nave," from the naval vessel). These crafts are capable of river navigation and coastal sea travel.
- **Features:** The Aquanave mode features retractable sails, oars, and rudders, with a hull designed for stability and speed in water. The internal space is efficiently organized to accommodate the needs of life at sea.

#### Transformation Process
- **Efficiency:** The transformation from Terrochar to Aquanave (and vice versa) is a swift process, honed by generations of Jirahar craftsmanship. It requires minimal effort and can be performed by the caravan dwellers themselves.
- **Community Effort:** Larger caravan camps can collectively transform into a fleet, showcasing a remarkable display of coordination and communal effort.
