**Description**: The artifact, known as the Heart of the Abyss, is a darkly gleaming gemstone, pulsating with an inner light that seems to swallow rather than emit light. It is encased in a vein of black mud, the very essence of Hell, hardened over millennia into a protective shell. The Heart's surface is etched with symbols that are not just visual but resonate with a palpable sense of dread, a language of the Adversary that predates human speech.

**Functionality**: The Heart of the Abyss serves as a conduit between the Material World and Hell, specifically the domain of the Adversary. It can amplify dark energies, weaken the veil between worlds, and, under the right conditions, summon forth entities from Hell, including powerful Sinners. Its mere presence begins to thin the barriers, allowing the lesser minions of Hell to seep into the Material World.

**Discovery and Significance**: The artifact was discovered in a ruin deep within the Whispering Woods, a site believed to have been a major ceremonial center for the ancient human civilization that worshipped the Adversary. This location was chosen for its strong ley lines, which the cultists manipulated to create a permanent rift between the worlds. The Grobi, sensitive to the energies of Hell due to their own origins linked to The Fury, were drawn to the artifact's awakening power.

**Indestructibility and Removal**: The Heart cannot be destroyed by any known means in the Material World; its creation was a dark ritual that bound it to the essence of the Adversary himself. Attempts to remove it from its resting place have failed, as it is bound by ancient spells and the black mud that encases it, which regenerates any damage inflicted upon it. Moreover, moving the Heart without proper containment could risk widening the rift it creates, potentially unleashing an uncontrollable flood of dark entities.

**The Grobi's Role and the Lesser Sinners**: A Lesser Sinner, a strategist in the shadowy war against the divine, revealed the artifact's location to the Grobi warlock, seeing them as pawns to further its own escape and ascendancy. This Sinner, bound to the will of the Adversary but seeking its own dominion, manipulated dreams and omens to guide the Grobi to the Heart, hoping they would unwittingly aid in its plan to summon a Sinner-Dragon, a being of immense power that could lead Hell's forces in a direct assault on the Material World.

**Connection to the Sinner-Dragon**: The artifact's ultimate purpose is to facilitate the summoning of a specific Sinner-Dragon, a creature whose strength and malevolence could turn the tide in the eternal battle between Hell and the divine. This Dragon, once a powerful lord who fell into darkness, seeks to return and lay waste to the Material World as the vanguard of Hell's armies. The summoning requires not just the Heart but a series of dark rituals and the alignment of celestial bodies, a plan set into motion with the artifact's discovery.

### Expansion and Implications

The discovery of the Heart of the Abyss by the Debtor's Corps sets off a chain of events that forces them to delve deeper into the mysteries of Hell, the Adversary, and the ancient civilization that once worshipped him. Their journey will uncover forgotten lore, challenge their understanding of their own world, and test their resolve as they confront the very essence of evil. The artifact's presence in the narrative serves as a focal point for the unfolding conflict, driving the story towards its climax in the confrontation with the Sinner-Dragon and the forces seeking to bring Hell to Earth.
