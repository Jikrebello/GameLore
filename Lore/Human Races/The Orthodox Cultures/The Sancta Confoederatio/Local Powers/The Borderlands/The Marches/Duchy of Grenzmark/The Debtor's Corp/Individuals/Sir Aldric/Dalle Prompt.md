Create an image of Sir Aldric, a knight with a storied past. He wears crusades-era armor that bears no signage, while slightly dirty and patchy with mismatching metal gauntlets, pauldrons, and breastplate, suggests a life of rugged adventure and battles hard-won. His two-handed longsword, pristine and engraved with holy scriptures down the center of its blade, hangs at his side, a beacon of his unyielding faith. Wrapped around one hand is a prayer rope/rosary, used to channel his divine magic for protection, healing, and smiting foes. His hair is a short, rough-cut style of muddy maroon red, matching his unkempt beard, showing his self-reliance and pragmatic approach to life. He wears leather traveling boots, reinforced with steel toe caps and shin guards, ready for the journey ahead. This ensemble paints the picture of a warrior marked by his transition from the sanctity of his order to the pragmatism required by his current role in a mercenary band
