As the Duchy of Grenzmark welcomes the amber hues of autumn, an undercurrent of tension simmers beneath the surface. The Debtor's Corps, a unit forged from necessity and bound by debts to the Fraternitas Argentarius, finds itself at the forefront of an emerging threat. Their duties, typically revolving around aiding in the seasonal migration of villagers and securing the southern territories against minor threats, take on a new urgency with early reports of Grobi scouting parties.

**[[The Unusual Grobi Activity]]**

The Grobi, a scattered and unruly threat, show uncharacteristic organization, launching raids on the southernmost villages of Grenzmark much earlier in the season than ever before. This deviation from their known behavior patterns alarms the leadership of the Debtor's Corps, prompting a series of fortified defenses around vulnerable villages and aggressive reconnaissance missions into the dense forests that cloak Grenzmark's southern borders.

**[[Discovery of the Central Encampment]]**

Persistent efforts by the Corps reveal a central Grobi encampment, deeply entrenched within the forest and seemingly focused on an ancient ruin. This finding is alarming, as the Grobi's newfound focus on excavation and exploration suggests a higher power at play, directing their actions towards a sinister goal.

**[[The Assault on the Encampment]]**

Recognizing the immediate threat posed by the Grobi's activities, the Corps mounts a significant assault on the encampment. The battle is fierce, pitting the Corps against Grobi forces and the ancient undead guardians of the ruin. Deep within the excavated site, they discover the Grobi have unearthed an artifact of dark power, unmistakably linked to the Adversary, a being of chaos and destruction from ancient legends.

**[[Recovery of the Artifact]]**

The Corps secures the artifact, defeating the Grobi's leader in the process, and brings it back to Festungshalt for containment and study. The artifact's presence is a double-edged sword, offering insight into the powers at play but also attracting unwanted attention from forces both within and outside the Duchy.

**[[The Lesser Sinners' Plans]]**

Unbeknownst to the Corps and the residents of Grenzmark, two Lesser Sinners work in the shadows, each with their own agenda tied to the awakening of the Sinner Dragon and the artifact's power. One, masquerading as a leader within the Corps, sees the artifact's recovery as an opportunity to further their own dark ambitions. Meanwhile, the other Lesser Sinner, orchestrating the Grobi's newfound organization, aims to use the chaos as cover for their own attempts to claim the artifact and summon the Sinner Dragon, viewing the Grobi and the undead as mere tools in their grand scheme.

**[[Preparations for Winter]]**

As autumn wanes, the Corps focuses on eradicating the remaining Grobi presence and finalizing the preparations for the harsh winter ahead. The artifact, now locked away within the depths of the Corps' barracks, remains a potent symbol of the looming conflict, its secrets and power a beacon to those who serve the Adversary.

**[[Foreshadowing and Unease]]**

The act closes with a palpable sense of unease. The early Grobi raids, the artifact's ominous power, and the shadowy machinations of the Lesser Sinners foreshadow a winter of unparalleled strife. The Corps, now guardians of an ancient evil, must brace for the challenges ahead, unaware of the betrayal that festers within their ranks and the true extent of the threat they face.

This expanded Act 1 sets the stage for a complex narrative of conflict, ancient powers, and hidden agendas, with the Duchy of Grenzmark caught in the balance. The stage is set for the unfolding drama of Winter's Siege, where the actions of the Lesser Sinners and the destiny of the artifact will drive the Corps and Grenzmark to the brink of despair and beyond.
