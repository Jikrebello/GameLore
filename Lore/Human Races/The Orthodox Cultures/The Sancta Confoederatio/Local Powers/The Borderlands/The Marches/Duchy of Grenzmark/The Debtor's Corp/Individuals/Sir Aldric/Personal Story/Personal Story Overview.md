#### Act 1: Shadows of the Past

- **Setup**: Sir Aldric joins the Debtor's Corp during the autumn preparations, his arrival in Festungshalt marked by a mixture of curiosity and skepticism from his new comrades. His skills are undeniable, but whispers of his past and the mysterious circumstances leading to his indebtedness follow him.
  
- **Conflict**: Assigned to a squad tasked with patrolling the Duchy's borders, Aldric's kleptomania resurfaces during a crucial mission. While investigating a Grobi encampment, he compulsively steals a seemingly insignificant trinket, inadvertently triggering a Grobi ambush. The squad barely escapes, and Aldric's actions cast doubt on his reliability and intentions.
  
- **Resolution**: Facing the consequences of his actions, Aldric confesses his condition to the squad, expecting rejection. Instead, he finds understanding and a willingness to help him overcome his compulsion. The act closes with Aldric vowing to make amends, his journey towards redemption beginning in earnest as he contributes to the squad's success in further skirmishes.

#### Act 2: Winter's Trial

- **Setup**: As winter tightens its grip on Grenzmark, the siege by the Grobi horde tests the Debtor's Corp to its limits. Aldric's squad is assigned to a high-risk mission behind enemy lines, targeting the Grobi warlock believed to be using the artifact to strengthen their forces.
  
- **Conflict**: The mission is fraught with danger, and Aldric's leadership and strategic mind come to the forefront. However, his kleptomania threatens to jeopardize the operation when he is drawn to an enchanted Grobi relic. This time, he resists the urge to steal, a testament to his growth and the trust his comrades have placed in him.
  
- **Resolution**: The successful sabotage of the Grobi's plans and the destruction of the relic dealing a blow to the enemy's morale showcase Aldric's redemption in action. The squad's return to Festungshalt is triumphant, but Aldric is left to ponder the fine line between his compulsions and his duties.

#### Act 3: The Spring of Redemption

- **Setup**: With the Grobi threat diminished and the duchy's people returning to their villages, Aldric and his squad face the final challenge: the undead uprising linked to the Adversary. Their investigation leads them to a confrontation with Lesser Sinners in the depths of an ancient dungeon.
  
- **Conflict**: The dungeon's dark magic exacerbates Aldric's kleptomania, tempting him with cursed artifacts. His struggle with his compulsion reaches its climax as he chooses to forsake a powerful relic, focusing instead on the mission and the safety of his team.
  
- **Resolution**: The defeat of the Lesser Sinners and the prevention of the Dragon's awakening mark the pinnacle of Aldric's redemption arc. His selfless actions earn him the respect and admiration of both the Debtor's Corp and the duchy's inhabitants. As spring heralds new beginnings, Aldric finds peace with his past and a renewed sense of purpose, knowing that while his journey with the Corp may end, his fight for redemption and service to others is only just beginning.

Sir Aldric's personal journey weaves through the larger narrative, adding depth and a human element to the epic tale of the Duchy of Grenzmark. His transformation from a disgraced knight to a redeemed hero embodies the themes of forgiveness, growth, and the enduring power of second chances.
