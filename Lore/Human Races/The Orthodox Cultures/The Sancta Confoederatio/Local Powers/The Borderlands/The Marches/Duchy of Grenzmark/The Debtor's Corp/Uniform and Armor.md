### Uniform and Armor Design

#### Base Layer
- **Gambeson**: The base layer of the uniform is a padded gambeson, offering protection against blunt force and providing insulation. The gambeson is tailored to allow for mobility and agility, crucial for the varied environments and combat situations the Corp faces. The color scheme could be a muted tone, like dark grey or deep green, with a subtle trim in the colors of the Fraternitas Argentarius to signify allegiance without drawing undue attention.

#### Chain Mail
- **Light Chain Mail**: Over the gambeson, members wear a sleeveless or short-sleeved chain mail shirt that extends to the mid-thigh. This layer offers additional protection against piercing and slashing without significantly increasing the weight carried by each member. The chain mail's design incorporates flexibility at the joints to ensure full range of motion.

#### Leather Accents
- **Leather Armor Pieces**: Strategic pieces of leather armor are used to reinforce areas prone to impact, such as the shoulders, chest, and shins. These pieces are designed to be sleek and form-fitting, enhancing protection without sacrificing the silhouette or mobility. The leather could be dyed in dark colors to match the gambeson, detailed with embossed symbols of the Corp or the Fraternitas, serving as a subtle mark of their identity.

#### Helmets and Headgear
- **Headgear**: Lightweight leather helmets or caps might be preferred for operations requiring stealth and speed. For more heavily armed engagements, metal helmets with a simple, functional design provide better protection. The helmets could feature a minimalist version of the Corp's emblem, such as a discreet engraving on the side or back.

#### Accessories and Utility
- **Belts and Harnesses**: Durable leather belts and harnesses carry essential gear, including weapons, pouches for supplies, and tools for specific missions. The design prioritizes ease of access and distribution of weight, ensuring that members can carry their equipment efficiently.

#### Shields and Weapons
- **Shields**: Following the Rodelero inspiration, small, maneuverable shields offer a balance between protection and offensive capability. These shields could incorporate the Corp's emblem in a low-contrast design, serving as a form of identification without compromising camouflage.
- **Weapons**: The choice of weapons would be practical and versatile, including short swords, daggers, and bows, allowing for a range of combat tactics from close quarters to ranged engagements.

### Conclusion

This approach to the Debtor Corp's uniform and armor merges the practicality and historical significance of the Spanish Rodelero with the specific needs of a mercenary group operating under the unique circumstances of their world. The result is a distinctive yet understated look that emphasizes functionality, protection, and a sense of unity among its members, all while subtly nodding to their affiliation with the Fraternitas Argentarius.
