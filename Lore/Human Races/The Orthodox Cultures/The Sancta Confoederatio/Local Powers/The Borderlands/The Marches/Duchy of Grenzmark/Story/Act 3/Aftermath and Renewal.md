In the quiet that follows the artifact's destruction, Grenzmark breathes a collective sigh of relief. The once relentless march of the undead ceases as if the very threads animating them have been cut. The landscape, marred by the scars of battle and the passage of dark forces, now stands silent under the watchful gaze of its protectors, the Debtor's Corps. Yet, this silence is not just a pause in the turmoil but a moment of introspection for the duchy and its defenders.

**Reckoning with Loss**

The immediate aftermath is a time of reckoning. The Corps, having emerged victorious from the depths of ancient evil, must now face the losses they've endured. The cost of their victory is measured not just in lives lost but in the trust shattered by the betrayal of one of their own. The revelation that a Lesser Sinner walked among them, undetected and influential, leaves a deep wound in the collective psyche of the Corps and the citizens of Festungshalt.

**Memorial and Mourning**

Grenzmark's inhabitants come together to mourn their fallen. Memorials spring up across the duchy, each a testament to the bravery and sacrifice of those who stood against the darkness. The Corps holds a solemn ceremony to honor their own, the names of the fallen echoing against the stone walls of Festungshalt. This shared grief becomes a binding force, a reminder of what was fought for and what was protected.

**Rebuilding and Renewal**

As the initial shock of the battles fades, the focus shifts to rebuilding. The Corps lends its strength to the effort, helping to repair the damage done to the seasonal villages and the city itself. The task is monumental, but it is met with a resilience born of hard-won victory. The process of renewal is not just physical but spiritual, as Grenzmark finds new strength in its unity. The betrayal and the darkness it brought have fostered a renewed vigilance in the duchy's inhabitants, a determination to guard against the shadows that still linger at the edges of the world.

**Strengthened Bonds**

The shared trials have forged stronger bonds between the Corps and the people of Grenzmark. The defenders are no longer seen just as debtors serving a sentence but as heroes who faced the abyss and returned to tell the tale. Their bravery and sacrifices are woven into the fabric of the duchy's history, becoming part of the legacy that will inspire future generations.

**A New Dawn**

As Grenzmark rebuilds, there's a sense that the victory over the darkness was not just an end but a beginning. The destruction of the artifact and the thwarting of the Lesser Sinners' plot have opened a new chapter for the duchy, one where the light shines a bit brighter against the dark. The Corps, now more than ever, stands as the guardian of that light, ever watchful for the stirrings of evil but bolstered by the knowledge that they have faced the worst and prevailed.

**Conclusion**

The aftermath of the battle against the Lesser Sinners and the darkness they sought to unleash is a time of reflection, mourning, and ultimately, renewal for Grenzmark. The duchy emerges from the shadow of the Adversary's legacy with a renewed sense of purpose and unity. The scars of the conflict will remain, a reminder of the cost of freedom and the eternal vigilance required to maintain it. Yet, in these scars, there is also a story of resilience, of a people who stood together in the face of unspeakable evil and carved out a beacon of hope in the darkness.
