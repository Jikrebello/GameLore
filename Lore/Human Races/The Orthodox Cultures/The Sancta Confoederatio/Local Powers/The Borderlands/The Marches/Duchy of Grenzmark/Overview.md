Festungshalt is not just the political and military center of the duchy; it's a thriving city that reflects the diverse aspects of life in Grenzmark. The city is divided into distinct sectors, each contributing to its survival and prosperity:

- **The Market Ring**: The economic heartbeat of Festungshalt, bustling with traders, artisans, and performers, where goods from across the Confederation and beyond are exchanged.
- **The Warren**: The residential core of the city, known for its densely packed bunkhouses and communal spaces, brimming with life, especially in winter when the population swells with residents from the countryside.
- **The Bastion**: Home to the duchy's defenders, including the elite Debtor Commandos, prepared to protect the city against any threat.
- **The Sacred Grounds**: Hosting the Cathedral of the Confederation, a beacon of faith and community support amidst the city's rugged setting.
