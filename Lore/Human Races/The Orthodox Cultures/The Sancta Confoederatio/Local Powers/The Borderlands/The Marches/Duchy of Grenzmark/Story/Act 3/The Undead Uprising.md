As spring heralds the renewal of the land, Grenzmark faces a new, grave threat—an undead uprising, a dark herald of the Lesser Sinner's ongoing ritual to awaken the Sinner Dragon. The resurgence of these skeletal armies, emerging from the depths of ancient ruins, presents a harrowing challenge to the already beleaguered Duchy.

### The Emergence of the Undead

As the snow melts and life seeks to reclaim the land, the dead, too, rise, but with no intention of yielding. From the shadowed entrances of forgotten tombs and decrepit dungeons, skeletal warriors, once the proud defenders or vile invaders of Grenzmark in ages past, now march again. Their emergence is not random but orchestrated by the dark will of the Lesser Sinner, who seeks to use these undead legions as both a diversion and a means to further their apocalyptic goals.

### The Corps' Strategic Division

Recognizing the dual threat of the undead's advance and the ongoing machinations within the ancient ruins, the Debtor's Corps swiftly divides its forces. Some squads are tasked with the defense of the seasonal villages, vital to Grenzmark's recovery and future prosperity. These villages, just beginning to stir with the promise of spring, find themselves under siege by forces that seek to strangle hope in its cradle.

### Sanctification Missions

Parallel to the efforts to defend and clear the villages, another critical strategy unfolds: sanctification missions. These missions, led by a combination of Corps members and church clergy, aim to sever the dark nexus points that fuel the undead's relentless surge. Each mission is a perilous journey into the heart of darkness, where the heroes of Grenzmark confront not only the physical threat of the undead but the pervasive corruption that seeks to erode their resolve.

### Race Against Time

As the Corps engages these skeletal armies and delves into the ruins, a desperate race against time begins. The sanctification of each site requires not just bravery but an understanding of ancient rites and the ability to counter the dark magics at play. The destruction of smaller artifacts found within these ruins becomes a key objective, each victory weakening the link between the Lesser Sinner's main artifact and the undead it commands.

### The Path to the Original Ruin

The Corps' efforts lead them inexorably back to the original ruin where the saga began—the site of the artifact's initial discovery. Here, they find a landscape transformed by the Lesser Sinner's ambitions. The excavation has deepened, revealing layers of the dungeon complex previously untouched by time or memory. The air is thick with dark magic, and the sense of an impending confrontation weighs heavily upon those brave enough to venture forth.

### Conclusion

As the Corps battles through the undead and the ruins' newly revealed depths, they are driven by a grim determination. Each sanctified site, each undead horde vanquished, brings them one step closer to confronting the Lesser Sinner and thwarting the ritual to awaken the Sinner Dragon. Yet, with each victory, the weight of their task becomes clearer—the battle for Grenzmark's soul is far from over, and the true depth of the conspiracy that entwines their fates with the legacy of the Adversary is only beginning to unfold.
