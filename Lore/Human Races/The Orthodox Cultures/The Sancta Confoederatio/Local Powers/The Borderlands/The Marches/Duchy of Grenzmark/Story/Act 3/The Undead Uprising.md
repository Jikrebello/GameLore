As spring heralds the renewal of the land, Grenzmark faces a new, grave threat—an undead uprising, a dark herald of the Lesser Sinner's ongoing ritual to awaken the Sinner Dragon. The resurgence of these skeletal armies, emerging from the depths of ancient ruins, presents a harrowing challenge to the already beleaguered Duchy.

### The Emergence of the Undead

As the snow melts and life seeks to reclaim the land, the dead, too, rise, but with no intention of yielding. From the shadowed entrances of forgotten tombs and decrepit dungeons, skeletal warriors, once the proud defenders or vile invaders of Grenzmark in ages past, now march again. Their emergence is not random but orchestrated by the dark will of the Lesser Sinner, who seeks to use these undead legions as both a diversion and a means to further their apocalyptic goals.

### The Corps' Strategic Division

The Corps, ever vigilant, quickly realizes the magnitude of the threat the undead represent. Under the command of seasoned leaders, they enact a swift and strategic division of their forces. Recognizing that their strength lies not just in arms but in their ability to adapt and respond to multiple threats simultaneously, the Corps formulates a dual-pronged strategy.

#### Defense of Seasonal Villages

A significant portion of the Corps is deployed to the seasonal villages, those bastions of hope where the people of Grenzmark seek to reclaim the land from winter's grasp. These villages, brimming with the promise of spring's bounty, become the frontline in the battle against the undead scourge.

- **Fortification and Defense:** Squads dedicated to village defense work tirelessly to erect barriers, dig trenches, and set traps. Their efforts transform each village into a fortress capable of withstanding the relentless assaults of the undead.
- **Community Training:** Recognizing that every villager is a potential defender of their home, the Corps initiates training programs. They teach combat techniques, the use of improvised weapons, and basic necrotic defense to empower the villagers, turning each settlement into a community of warriors.
- **Patrols and Early Warning Systems:** Patrol teams are established to monitor the perimeters of the villages, using a combination of traditional scouting and arcane sensing to detect approaching threats. Signal fires, warning bells, and runners keep the lines of communication open, ensuring that no village stands alone.

### Sanctification Missions

Parallel to the defensive efforts, another segment of the Corps, accompanied by clerics from the Clericus Imperium, embarks on sanctification missions. These missions target the dark nexus points within the ancient ruins, the sources from which the undead hordes draw their unholy vitality.

- **Infiltration and Cleansing:** Teams of Corps members and clergy delve into the heart of darkness, navigating traps and battling guardians to reach the core of each ruin. There, clerics perform ancient rites to cleanse the site, severing its connection to the necrotic forces and halting the flow of undead.
- **Artifacts and Relics:** The missions also focus on the recovery or destruction of cursed artifacts that anchor the ruins' dark power. Each successful mission weakens the undead's hold on the land, a step toward reclaiming Grenzmark from the shadow of death.
- **Coordination with Local Forces:** These sanctification teams coordinate closely with the defenders of the seasonal villages, ensuring that as each ruin is cleansed, the surrounding area receives immediate reinforcement to capitalize on the diminishing undead presence.

As the undead scourge casts its pall over Grenzmark, sanctification missions emerge as a beacon of hope, a testament to the indomitable spirit of its defenders. These missions, born out of necessity and desperation, become the linchpin in the strategy to reclaim the land from the grip of darkness. Orchestrated with precision, they require a unity of purpose between the martial prowess of the Debtor's Corps and the divine guidance of the Clericus Imperium's clergy.

### The Nature of Sanctification Missions

Each sanctification mission is a meticulously planned operation, targeting the ancient ruins scattered throughout Grenzmark—sites now corrupted into dark nexus points that anchor the undead to the mortal realm. These places, once ancient centers of dark worship and burial, have been awoken to their true, ancient purpose, gateways for necrotic energies that fuel the undead legions.

- **Preparation and Planning:** Before embarking on these perilous journeys, teams are briefed on their objectives, the known hazards, and the historical significance of the target site. Artefacts, ancient texts, and maps are studied to understand the layout and potential traps or guardians that may lie in wait.
- **Team Composition:** Each team is a balanced assembly of Corps warriors, seasoned in combat against the undead, and Clericus clergy, trained in the rites of sanctification and protection against dark magic. This combination of sword and sanctity is crucial to overcoming the challenges that await.

### The Journey into Darkness

The missions lead the teams deep into the heart of the blighted ruins. Each step forward is contested by the undead and other, more eldritch guardians left to protect the site's corruption.

- **Confronting the Guardians:** The teams face not only reanimated corpses but also spectral entities and demonic beings bound to the nexus points. These encounters test the teams' resolve, as they must not only fight but also resist the psychological warfare waged by these creatures.
- **Ritual of Cleansing:** At the heart of each ruin lies the focal point of corruption. Here, the clergy perform intricate rituals to cleanse the site, a process requiring protection as they chant prayers and incantations, invoking the light to purge the darkness.

### Challenges and Adversities

The sanctification missions are fraught with dangers beyond the undead. The very fabric of these places is steeped in malevolence, presenting unique challenges to the teams.

- **Magical Traps and Curses:** The ancient protectors of these sites left behind traps imbued with dark magic, designed to thwart intruders. Disarming or navigating these hazards requires both martial skill and arcane knowledge.
- **Corruption's Toll:** The pervasive dark energy seeks to infiltrate the minds and souls of the intruders, sowing doubt, fear, and despair. Clerics bear talismans and wards to shield the team, but the psychological strain is a constant battle.

### Triumphs and Tribulations

With each successful mission, a wave of relief washes over Grenzmark. The undead's ranks thin, their advance halts, and the land begins to heal from their blight. Yet, these victories are not without cost.

- **Losses and Sacrifices:** Not all who venture into the darkness return. The missions claim the lives of brave souls, their sacrifices honored by the Corps and the Clericus alike.
- **Renewed Resolve:** Each mission strengthens the resolve of Grenzmark's defenders. The successes, bought with blood and bravery, serve as a rallying cry for the duchy, a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming darkness, the light endures.

The sanctification missions stand as a testament to the courage and unity of Grenzmark's defenders. In the face of an ancient evil that seeks to suffocate the land's rebirth, these missions carve a path toward renewal, embodying the belief that even the deepest darkness can be vanquished by the light.

### Race Against Time

As the Corps engages these skeletal armies and delves into the ruins, a desperate race against time begins. The sanctification of each site requires not just bravery but an understanding of ancient rites and the ability to counter the dark magics at play. The destruction of smaller artifacts found within these ruins becomes a key objective, each victory weakening the link between the Lesser Sinner's main artifact and the undead it commands.

### The Path to the Original Ruin

The Corps' efforts lead them inexorably back to the original ruin where the saga began—the site of the artifact's initial discovery. Here, they find a landscape transformed by the Lesser Sinner's ambitions. The excavation has deepened, revealing layers of the dungeon complex previously untouched by time or memory. The air is thick with dark magic, and the sense of an impending confrontation weighs heavily upon those brave enough to venture forth.

### Conclusion

As the Corps battles through the undead and the ruins' newly revealed depths, they are driven by a grim determination. Each sanctified site, each undead horde vanquished, brings them one step closer to confronting the Lesser Sinner and thwarting the ritual to awaken the Sinner Dragon. Yet, with each victory, the weight of their task becomes clearer—the battle for Grenzmark's soul is far from over, and the true depth of the conspiracy that entwines their fates with the legacy of the Adversary is only beginning to unfold.
