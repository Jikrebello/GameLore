As the Duchy of Grenzmark transitions from the lush verdancy of summer to the mellow tones of autumn, the Debtor's Corps engages in its annual routines, marking the rhythm of the seasons with practiced efficiency. Their tasks, deeply woven into the fabric of Grenzmark's communal life, span from aiding the villagers in their migration from seasonal villages to securing the perimeters against the common threats that prowl the edges of civilization.

**The Onset of Autumn**

The beginning of autumn is traditionally a time of preparation and vigilance for the coming winter. The Corps assists in the migration, ensuring that the passage from the outlying villages to the safety of more central, fortified locations is seamless and secure. This process involves not only physical protection but also the boarding up and securing of abandoned homes and stores, leaving behind a landscape of shuttered windows and barred doors, standing silent watch over the empty streets.

**Emerging Threats from the Forest**

However, this autumn unfolds differently. Reports of Grobi scouting parties, erratic and disorganized under normal circumstances, begin to filter in with alarming frequency and detail. These reports are not the usual scattered sightings but accounts of coordinated movements and raids on the southernmost villages, striking with a precision and organization previously unattribated to the Grobi.

**The Corps' Response**

The leadership of the Debtor's Corps, accustomed to the Grobi's sporadic forays, finds the new pattern of aggression deeply troubling. It contradicts the known behavior of the Grobi, suggesting a shift in their dynamics or, more concerning, an external influence marshaling their actions.

In response, the Corps adjusts its strategies:

- **Fortified Defenses**: Squads are dispatched to reinforce the southern villages with both manpower and materials, erecting barricades, setting up watchtowers, and instituting night patrols to guard against the Grobi raids.
  
- **Aggressive Reconnaissance**: Recognizing the need for actionable intelligence, the Corps launches reconnaissance missions deeper into the forest than ever before. These missions aim not only to track the movements of the Grobi scouting parties but also to locate their camps and, if possible, identify the source of their newfound coordination.

- **Pre-emptive Strikes**: Armed with information gleaned from their reconnaissance, the Corps initiates a series of pre-emptive strikes against the smaller Grobi encampments. These raids, carried out with precision and stealth, aim to disrupt the Grobi's momentum and deter further incursions before the onset of winter can embolden them.
