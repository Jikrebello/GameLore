#### Background and Personality
**Lucan** hails from a family with generations rooted in winemaking, known for a modest but proud vineyard that has produced quality wines for the local market. Unlike his kin, who possess an innate grace and diplomacy, Lucan has always been more straightforward and pragmatic, often finding the elaborate social dances of his homeland perplexing and unnecessary.

Lucan's lack of subtlety and his direct approach to communication led to several failed business ventures and social faux pas, culminating in a series of unfortunate deals that nearly bankrupted his family's vineyard. Burdened with guilt and debt, he saw enlistment in the Debtor's Corp not as a punishment but as a refugeâ€”a place where clarity of purpose and direct action are valued over social maneuvering.

#### Life in the Debtor's Corp
In the Corp, Lucan has found a sense of belonging that eluded him in **[[Comitatus Vinorum]]**. The straightforward nature of military life, where orders are to be followed and objectives are clear, suits him well. He excels on the battlefield, where his focus and ability to see clarity amid the chaos of battle make him a proficient swordsman and shield-bearer. His directness, often a liability in his previous life, becomes an asset in the planning and executing missions.

Despite his adaptation to and preference for life in the Corp, Lucan harbors a deep-seated fear of his eventual return to **[[Comitatus Vinorum]]**. The thought of re-entering a society where he never quite fit in, with its intricate social cues and expectations, fills him with dread.
