### Act 2: Elara's Winter's Siege Expanded

#### Setup: The Siege Begins
- **The Cold Strategy**: As Festungshalt braces against the Grobi siege and the unnatural winter brought forth by the Emerald Drake, Lady Elara's dual life becomes even more complex. Tasked with critical reconnaissance and sabotage missions, she uses her noble intellect and rogue skills to navigate the siege's dangers. Her leadership in these missions, while invaluable to the Debtor's Corps, also serves her private investigation into the Fraternitas Argentarius's shadowy role in her past.

Her findings suggest a disturbing connection between the Fraternitas's pursuit of power and the forces besieging Festungshalt.

#### Conflict: The Mission and the Revelation
- **Behind Enemy Lines**: A daring mission to disrupt the Grobi's supply lines leads Elara and a select team deep into enemy territory. Here, Elara encounters a disillusioned member of the Fraternitas, a link to her husband's secretive dealings with the organization. The encounter reveals her husband's involvement in acquiring forbidden artifacts for the Fraternitas, a quest that ultimately led to his ruin and untimely death.
- **The Artifact's Shadow**: The mission uncovers evidence of an ancient relic, similar to the one found in Act 1, being used by the Grobi to fuel their siege engines with dark energy.

- **A Bittersweet Victory**: As Festungshalt celebrates the siege's end and the Drake's defeat, Elara's personal victory is tinged with the bitterness of uncovered truths.
