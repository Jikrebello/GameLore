The discovery and subsequent recovery of an ancient artifact linked to the Adversary by the Debtor's Corps marks a turning point in the battle against the Grobi encampment and the broader struggle for the Duchy of Grenzmark's safety. The operation to secure the artifact unfolds amid fierce combat, strategic maneuvers, and the unveiling of dark forces long dormant beneath the duchy's soil.

**The Final Assault on the Encampment**

Under the cloak of pre-dawn shadows, elite squads of the Debtor's Corps, armed with the intelligence gathered from their reconnaissance missions, launch a decisive assault on the Grobi encampment. Their approach, silent yet swift, aims to disrupt the Grobi forces before they can rally their defenses. The battle that ensues is chaotic, a maelstrom of steel and sorcery as the Corps members fight tooth and nail against a foe emboldened by dark energies emanating from the ruin.

**Encounter with the Grobi Leader**

Deep within the heart of the encampment, amidst the excavated ruins that serve as a makeshift fortress, the Corps confronts the Grobi's leader. This formidable Orc, adorned with symbols of the Adversary and wielding power granted by the unearthed artifact, represents the pinnacle of the Grobi's unnatural hierarchy. The clash is intense, a testament to the Corps' training and resolve as they face an enemy enhanced by the artifact's dark aura.

**Discovery and Recovery of the Artifact**

In the aftermath of the confrontation, amidst the rubble of the ruined encampment and the fallen Grobi, the Corps stumbles upon the artifact. Its appearance is ominous, pulsing with a malevolent energy that resonates with the very air around it. The decision to retrieve the artifact is unanimous; leaving it in the ruins or, worse, allowing it to fall back into Grobi hands, would spell disaster for Grenzmark.

**Transport and Containment**

The journey back to Festungshalt with the artifact is fraught with tension. The Corps takes every precaution to shield the artifact from prying eyes, using cloaks imbued with runes of concealment and silence. Upon their return, the artifact is immediately taken to a secure vault beneath the Corps' barracks, a location reinforced with wards and spells designed to contain its dark energy.

**The Artifact's Study and Implications**

In the relative safety of Festungshalt, scholars and mages allied with the Corps begin the delicate process of studying the artifact. Their research aims to unravel its origins, understand its connection to the Adversary, and decipher a means to neutralize its threat. However, the artifact's presence in Festungshalt does not go unnoticed. Whispers of its power and the battle for its possession stir interest from various factions within and beyond the duchy, hinting at the intricate web of intrigue and power struggles that envelop Grenzmark.

**The Artifact as a Beacon**

The recovery of the artifact, while a tactical victory, also acts as a beacon, drawing attention to Festungshalt and the Debtor's Corps. Allies and adversaries alike become keenly aware of the artifact's existence, setting the stage for future conflicts and alliances. The Corps finds itself at the center of a gathering storm, holding a key to untold power that could either safeguard the duchy or lead to its downfall.

**Conclusion**

The recovery of the artifact by the Debtor's Corps is a moment of triumph tinged with foreboding. As they secure this relic of ancient darkness, they must navigate the perilous waters of political intrigue, ancient curses, and the ever-present threat of the Adversary's return. The artifact, a symbol of the looming conflict with the darkness, remains under the vigilant guard of the Corps, a testament to their role as the bulwark against chaos in the Duchy of Grenzmark.
