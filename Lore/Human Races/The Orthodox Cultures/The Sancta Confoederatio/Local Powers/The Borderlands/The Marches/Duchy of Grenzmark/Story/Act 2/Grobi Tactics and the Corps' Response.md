The winter siege of Grenzmark reveals the Grobi not as mere raiders but as a formidable army, employing tactics that blur the lines between the physical and the supernatural. At the heart of their newfound strategy lies the dark influence of a warlock Lesser Sinner, wielding an artifact of necromantic power. This power not only bolsters the Grobi ranks but also raises the dead to fight alongside them, presenting a dual threat that tests the mettle of the Debtor's Corps and the city militia.

**The Evolving Threat**

As the siege unfolds, the Grobi's tactics evolve from hit-and-run raids to a sustained assault on the city's defenses. Siege engines, crudely constructed but effective, bombard the city walls, while raiding parties attempt to breach the gates. The use of undead soldiers, a horrifying new development, adds a layer of psychological warfare to the physical battle, demoralizing defenders with the sight of fallen comrades turned against them.

**The Grobi Warlock's Artifact**

The warlock, orchestrating the siege from a sprawling camp at the forest's edge, possesses a lesser artifact imbued with dark energy. Though not as potent as the artifact secured within the city, it grants them significant power—enough to control the Grobi with an iron will and to animate the dead. This artifact becomes a focal point of the Grobi's assault, its presence on the battlefield amplifying the threat they pose.

**The Corps' Guerrilla Warfare**

In response to the Grobi's siege tactics, the Debtor's Corps adapts its military strategy to leverage its mobility and knowledge of the land. Special ops squads, skilled in stealth and reconnaissance, trace the Grobi's movements back to their source, uncovering the location of the siege camp. Utilizing guerrilla tactics, these squads launch night raids on the camp, targeting siege engines for sabotage and sowing chaos within the Grobi ranks to disrupt their cohesion and command structure.

**Naval Defense and the Lake of Echoes**

An attempted Grobi invasion via the Lake of Echoes underscores the warlock's ambition to encircle and suffocate the city. The Debtor's Corps, anticipating this move, fortifies the docks and employs the city's naval capabilities to repel the attackers. This engagement highlights the Grobi's lack of naval proficiency and showcases the Corps' adaptability, turning the lake into a defensive advantage rather than a vulnerability.

**The Lesser Sinners' Rivalry**

Beneath the surface of this conflict lies a deeper struggle between two Lesser Sinners, each vying to complete the summoning of the Sinner Dragon for their own gain. The warlock, despite wielding a lesser artifact, advances their ritual with each battle, drawing ever closer to their dark goal. In contrast, the Infiltrator within the city, lacking knowledge of the ritual but having access to the more powerful artifact, plays a dangerous game of manipulation, seeking to learn the secrets of the summoning before their rival can achieve success. This rivalry adds a layer of intrigue and desperation to the siege, with both Sinners willing to sacrifice anything—or anyone—to claim the promised reward of their dark patron.

### Conclusion

The siege of Grenzmark is a testament to the complexity of the conflict engulfing the duchy. The Grobi, transformed into a disciplined army by dark sorcery, present a challenge unlike any the Debtor's Corps has faced. The introduction of necromantic tactics and the strategic use of a lesser artifact amplify the threat, forcing the Corps to innovate and adapt in their defense of the city. Amidst the chaos of battle, the shadowy machinations of the Lesser Sinners drive the conflict towards an uncertain conclusion, with the fate of Grenzmark hanging in the balance.
