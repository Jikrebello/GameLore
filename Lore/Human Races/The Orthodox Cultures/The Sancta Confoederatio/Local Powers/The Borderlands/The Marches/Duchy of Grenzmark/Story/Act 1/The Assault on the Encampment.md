The decision to assault the Grobi encampment, nestled deep within the southern forests of Grenzmark, marks a turning point in the Debtor's Corps' autumn campaign. The Corps, recognizing the gravity of the Grobi's newfound organization and their excavation of an ancient ruin, mobilizes with a sense of urgency that underscores the operation's critical nature.

**Preparation and Mobilization**

The Corps meticulously plans the assault, gathering intelligence on the encampment's layout, defenses, and the number of Grobi present. Squads are briefed under the cloak of secrecy, with each member understanding the mission's stakes. Specialized units, equipped with siege weapons and magical artifacts to counter the Grobi's dark sorcery, are positioned at the forefront of the assault.

**The Battle Commences**

The attack is launched at dawn, taking advantage of the misty cover to mask the Corps' approach. Initial clashes are brutal, with the Corps facing fierce resistance from Grobi warriors who are surprisingly well-prepared for the attack. The battle's cacophony, a blend of steel, sorcery, and primal war cries, echoes through the forest, signaling a conflict that will be remembered in Grenzmark's annals.

**Penetrating the Encampment**

As the outer defenses crumble under the Corps' relentless assault, the battle moves deeper into the encampment. Here, amidst the makeshift structures and excavated earth, the Corps encounters not only Grobi but also ancient undead guardians, risen from the ruin's depths to protect its secrets. These undead, wielding powers long forgotten, present a new challenge, forcing the Corps to adapt their tactics on the fly.

**Discovery of the Artifact**

The heart of the encampment reveals the ruin's entrance, now a gaping maw leading into darkness. Corps squads, pushing forward, enter the ruin, their path lit by torches and the glow of magical wards. It is within these ancient halls, untouched by time, that they confront the head Orc, a Grobi chieftain empowered by dark sorcery and guarding the recently unearthed artifact.

The confrontation is intense, a test of both skill and will, as the Corps battles the Grobi chieftain and his undead minions. In the ruin's inner sanctum, they discover the artifact â€” a relic pulsing with malevolent energy, its surface etched with symbols that whisper of the Adversary.

**Securing the Artifact**

With the chieftain defeated and the ruin secured, the Corps retrieves the artifact. The decision to bring it back to the city for further study is unanimous; its power, clearly linked to the forces of chaos and destruction, must be understood and contained. The artifact's removal from the ruin feels like a theft of shadow from darkness itself, a deed that does not go unnoticed by unseen watchers with malevolent intent.

**Aftermath and Reflection**

The assault on the encampment concludes with the Corps victorious but sobered by the day's events. The presence of the artifact and the undead guardians suggests a deeper, more ancient threat than the Grobi raids alone. As they return to the city, the artifact in tow, the Corps contemplates the implications of their discovery. The ruin, the artifact, and the Grobi's uncharacteristic behavior are pieces of a larger puzzle that Grenzmark must solve to safeguard its future.

The debriefings that follow emphasize the need for vigilance and further exploration of the ruin's depths. The artifact, now secured within the Corps' barracks, represents a potential key to understanding the Adversary's influence and the dark powers at play in Grenzmark. The battle may have ended, but the war against the darkness has only just begun.
