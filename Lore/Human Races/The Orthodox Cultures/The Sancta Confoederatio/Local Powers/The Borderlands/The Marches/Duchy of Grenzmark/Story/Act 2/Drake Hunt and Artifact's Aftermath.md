In the aftermath of the Grobi siege, the city of Festungshalt finds itself at a crossroads of emotion—relief and despair intermingling in the hearts of its defenders. The Debtor's Corps, split between their dual missions of dragon hunting and siege breaking, now faces the consequences of their actions and the shadow of a future fraught with uncertainty.

**The Drake Hunt's Conclusion**

The squad tasked with hunting the Emerald Drake, having ventured deep into the uncharted wilderness that borders the duchy, returns to Festungshalt victorious but visibly shaken. Their mission, fraught with danger and unexpected challenges, culminates in the slaying of the drake, a creature of ancient magic and raw power. The battle, a harrowing dance of strategy, magic, and sheer will, ends with the drake's demise in a secluded valley where the forest meets the mountains.

Amidst the drake's nest, the squad uncovers relics and treasures long guarded by the creature—artifacts of a forgotten age, their significance and power yet to be fully understood. These spoils, while a testament to the squad's bravery, serve as a somber reminder of the cost of their victory, both in lives and the innocence lost to the horrors witnessed.

**The Siege's End**

Simultaneously, the squad confronting the Grobi warlock Lesser Sinner achieves a pyrrhic victory of their own. The artifact's destruction and the warlock's demise mark the end of the Grobi's coordinated assault on Festungshalt. With the source of their necromantic empowerment shattered, the undead horde crumbles, and the remaining Grobi forces scatter into the wilderness, leaderless and broken.

The city, though spared from annihilation, bears the scars of the siege. Buildings lay in ruin, fields smolder with the remnants of battle, and the air is thick with the grief of those lost. The defenders' morale, buoyed by the victory, is tempered by the knowledge of the betrayal within their ranks—the theft of the artifact by the Infiltrator Lesser Sinner casting a long shadow over their triumph.

**Reunion and Reflection**

The reunion of the two squads within the walls of Festungshalt is a moment of somber reflection. Their victories, significant though they are, feel diminished in the wake of the artifact's theft and the ominous portents it heralds. The Corps gathers, their faces a mosaic of exhaustion, relief, and unresolved tension, as they share tales of their respective battles.

Leadership within the Corps and the city's governance convene in urgent council, grappling with the immediate aftermath of the siege and the looming threat of the Sinner Dragon's awakening. The realization that their enemy is now armed with the knowledge and means to unleash an ancient evil upon Grenzmark weighs heavily upon the room.

**Preparation for What Lies Ahead**

As the initial relief of the siege's end gives way to a determined resolve, the Debtor's Corps and the people of Festungshalt begin the arduous process of rebuilding. The victories against the Emerald Drake and the Grobi warlock are commemorated, their stories woven into the tapestry of Grenzmark's history, a testament to the courage and sacrifice of its defenders.

Yet, in the quiet moments between the rebuilding efforts, the whispered conversations among the Corps' members, and the solemn vigils for the fallen, there is a shared acknowledgment of the challenges to come. The artifact's theft, the specter of the Lesser Sinners' ambitions, and the dread of the Sinner Dragon's awakening forge a new resolve within the hearts of Grenzmark's defenders. United by their trials and the battles yet to come, they stand ready to face the darkness, their spirits tempered by the fires of adversity.
