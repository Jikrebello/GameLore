As the deep chill of winter envelops Grenzmark, dark clouds gather not just in the sky but on the horizon of the duchy's future. The Grobi, once mere nuisances scattered throughout the forest's edge, have transformed into a formidable force of destruction under the sinister guidance of a warlock Lesser Sinner. This unexpected turn of events thrusts Grenzmark into a state of heightened alert as the Grobi hordes initiate a campaign of terror and violence, the likes of which the duchy has never before seen.

**The Onset of Winter's Campaign**

With the first frost, the Grobi's tactics evolve dramatically. Raiding parties, larger and more organized than any before, begin to probe the city's defenses. These initial forays serve a dual purpose: testing the resilience of Grenzmark's defenses and instilling fear among its populace. The warlock's dark influence is evident in the Grobi's newfound discipline and the malevolent energy that seems to bolster their ranks.

**Tactical Probing and Psychological Warfare**

The Grobi's raids grow increasingly bold, striking at outlying farms, isolated hamlets, and key defensive outposts. Each attack is meticulously planned, exploiting weaknesses and sowing chaos. The warlock, using dark sorcery, enhances the Grobi warriors, making them fiercer in battle and harder to kill. Tales of these enhanced Grobi spread quickly, undermining the morale of the city's defenders and citizens alike.

**The Warlock's Dark Aegis**

At the heart of this orchestrated siege is the warlock Lesser Sinner, a figure shrouded in mystery and terrifying power. From a hidden sanctum deep within the forest, they direct the Grobi hordes, their ambitions extending far beyond mere conquest. The warlock seeks to break the will of Grenzmark, to turn it into a bastion of darkness for the Adversary. The rituals conducted, bolstered by the stolen energies of the artifact, threaten to tear open the very fabric of reality, allowing the Adversary's influence to flood the duchy.

**The Response of the Debtor's Corps**

The Debtor's Corps, led by commanders both brave and bold, rally the city's defenses. Fortifications are strengthened, patrols doubled, and every able-bodied citizen is called to arms. The Corps leads sorties against the Grobi raiding parties, aiming to disrupt their attacks and gather intelligence on the warlock's location. These missions are fraught with danger, as the Grobi, emboldened by dark magic, prove to be formidable opponents.

**The Siege's Toll on Grenzmark**

As winter deepens, so does the siege's grip on Grenzmark. Food supplies begin to dwindle, casualties mount, and the constant pressure of defending against an unseen, seemingly invincible foe wears heavily on the defenders' spirits. The warlock's strategy becomes clear: to exhaust Grenzmark's defenses through relentless assault, paving the way for a final, devastating strike.

**Conclusion**

The siege of Grenzmark, driven by the dark ambitions of a Lesser Sinner and executed by a Grobi horde unlike any before, marks a dark chapter in the duchy's history. The people of Grenzmark, from the highest noble to the humblest farmer, find themselves united against a common enemy, their fate hanging in the balance. The Debtor's Corps stands as the thin line between survival and destruction, their resolve tested as never before. As the siege intensifies, so too does the resolve of Grenzmark's defenders, their courage the only light in the deepening darkness of winter's embrace.
