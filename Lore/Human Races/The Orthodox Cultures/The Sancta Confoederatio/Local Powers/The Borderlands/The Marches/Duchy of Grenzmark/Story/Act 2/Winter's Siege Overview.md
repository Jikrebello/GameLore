Winter's siege on Grenzmark unfurls with ferocity, as prophesized by the autumn's ominous shadows. The Debtor's Corps, now veterans of the duchy's dark underbelly, find themselves bracing against a multifront onslaught orchestrated by forces seen and unseen.

**[[The Siege Intensifies]]**

Grenzmark's worst fears materialize as Grobi hordes, previously a disorganized threat, launch coordinated attacks under the dark aegis of a warlock, a Lesser Sinner with ambitions that spell doom for the duchy. The city's defenses are tested by probing raids, each revealing the Grobi's newfound cunning and malice.

**[[Grobi Tactics and the Corps' Response]]**

The Grobi's tactics, a blend of brute force and necromantic sorcery, challenge the Corps and city militia alike. Special ops squads trace raiding parties back to their source, uncovering a sprawling siege camp at the forest's edge, teeming with Grobi warriors and the undead. The Corps employs guerrilla tactics, striking under the cover of night to sabotage siege engines and incite chaos within the Grobi ranks.

**[[The Emerald Drake's Awakening]]**

Amidst this orchestrated chaos, an ancient Emerald Drake, roused from its hibernation by the conflict's reverberations, becomes an unforeseen variable. Its assault on both Grobi and Grenzmark alike forces the Corps to split their focus, defending the city from aerial devastation while contending with the siege.

**[[Confrontation with the Lesser Sinner]]**

The pinnacle of the siege's drama unfolds as the Corps confronts the Grobi Warlock, revealing his true nature as a Lesser Sinner. In a desperate gambit, they manage to shatter the artifact empowering him, quelling the undead tide he unleashed. His dying curse, a portent of the Sinner Dragon's inevitable awakening, chills the victors to their core.

**[[Betrayal and Theft]]**

Parallel to the battlefield's valor, treachery unfurls within Festungshalt's walls. The Infiltrator Lesser Sinner, cloaked in the guise of a Corps leader, seizes the turmoil's climax to abscond with the artifact recovered in autumn after finally learning the steps needed to perform the summoning ritual. Their transformation and escape, laden with the artifact's dark power, mark a profound betrayal, leaving a scar on the city's heart and morale.

**[[Drake Hunt and Artifact's Aftermath]]**

As one squad hunts the wounded Emerald Drake, slaying it amidst the mountains with cunning and bravery, another squad dismantles the Grobi's siege with the warlock's fall. Yet, victory is tainted by the artifact's theft and the duchy's looming dread of what comes next. The two squads' reunion in Festungshalt is a somber convergence, their successes overshadowed by the greater darkness that slips through their fingers.

**[[Lesser Sinners' Diverging Paths]]**

The Lesser Sinners, each with their artifact and ambition, diverge in their quest to awaken the Sinner Dragon. The slain warlock's plans lay in ruins, while the betrayer moves to the ancient ruins, intent on completing the dark ritual. Their machinations set the stage for an unseen battle, with the Corps and Grenzmark caught in the crossfire, unaware of the full extent of the conspiracy entwining their fates with the Adversary's legacy.

### Act 2 Conclusion

Winter's siege leaves Grenzmark both victorious and vulnerable. The Debtor's Corps, hailed as defenders, grapple with the bitter taste of betrayal and the unfathomable loss of the artifact. As the snows thaw, the seeds of discord and fear sown by the Lesser Sinners threaten to sprout, foretelling a spring of reckoning where the true extent of the Adversary's shadow will be unveiled. The stage is set for heroes to rise, alliances to be forged, and for the darkness to be confronted in the heart of Grenzmark and beyond.
