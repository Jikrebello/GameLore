Winter's siege on Grenzmark unfurls with ferocity, as prophesized by the autumn's ominous shadows. The Debtor's Corps, now veterans of the duchy's dark underbelly, find themselves bracing against a multifront onslaught orchestrated by forces seen and unseen.

**[[The Siege Intensifies]]**

Grenzmark's worst fears materialize as Grobi hordes, previously a disorganized threat, launch coordinated attacks under the dark aegis of a warlock, a Lesser Sinner with ambitions that spell doom for the duchy. The city's defenses are tested by probing raids, each revealing the Grobi's newfound cunning and malice.

**[[Grobi Tactics and the Corps' Response]]**

The Grobi's tactics, a blend of brute force and necromantic sorcery, challenge the Corps and city militia alike. Special ops squads trace raiding parties back to their source, uncovering a sprawling siege camp at the forest's edge, teeming with Grobi warriors and the undead. The Corps employs guerrilla tactics, striking under the cover of night to sabotage siege engines and incite chaos within the Grobi ranks.

**[[The Emerald Drake's Awakening]]**

Amidst this orchestrated chaos, an ancient Emerald Drake, roused from its hibernation by the conflict's reverberations, becomes an unforeseen variable. Its assault on both Grobi and Grenzmark alike forces the Corps to split their focus, defending the city from aerial devastation while contending with the siege.

**[[Confrontation with the Lesser Sinner]]**

The pinnacle of the siege's drama unfolds as the Corps confronts the Grobi Warlock, revealing his true nature as a Lesser Sinner. In a desperate gambit, they manage to shatter the artifact empowering him, quelling the undead tide he unleashed. His dying curse, a portent of the Sinner Dragon's inevitable awakening, chills the victors to their core.

**Betrayal and Theft**

Parallel to the battlefield's valor, treachery unfurls within Festungshalt's walls. Another Lesser Sinner, cloaked in the guise of a Corps leader, seizes the turmoil's climax to abscond with the artifact recovered in autumn. Their transformation and escape, laden with the artifact's dark power, mark a profound betrayal, leaving a scar on the city's heart and morale.

**Dragon Hunt and Artifact's Aftermath**

As one squad hunts the wounded Emerald Drake, slaying it amidst the mountains with cunning and bravery, another squad dismantles the Grobi's siege with the warlock's fall. Yet, victory is tainted by the artifact's theft and the duchy's looming dread of what comes next. The two squads' reunion in Festungshalt is a somber convergence, their successes overshadowed by the greater darkness that slips through their fingers.

**Lesser Sinners' Diverging Paths**

The Lesser Sinners, each with their artifact and ambition, diverge in their quest to awaken the Sinner Dragon. The slain warlock's plans lay in ruins, while the betrayer moves to the ancient ruins, intent on completing the dark ritual. Their machinations set the stage for an unseen battle, with the Corps and Grenzmark caught in the crossfire, unaware of the full extent of the conspiracy entwining their fates with the Adversary's legacy.

### Act 2 Conclusion

Winter's siege leaves Grenzmark both victorious and vulnerable. The Debtor's Corps, hailed as defenders, grapple with the bitter taste of betrayal and the unfathomable loss of the artifact. As the snows thaw, the seeds of discord and fear sown by the Lesser Sinners threaten to sprout, foretelling a spring of reckoning where the true extent of the Adversary's shadow will be unveiled. The stage is set for heroes to rise, alliances to be forged, and for the darkness to be confronted in the heart of Grenzmark and beyond.


the fears of this winter being a far more deadly and dangerous one turns out to be true, as the grobi hordes really start coming through as winter begins. Initially, they dont attack the city head on, instead sending out raiding parties to prob and test the defences of the city, which makes it all the more a concern for the residents of the city and its leaders. The corp split their duties between defending against these raiding parties and sending special ops squads to gather intel about the grobi, their numbers and what they are up to via the tracks of the raiding parties when they retreat back into the forest. They are able to gain a small amount of information, but the full scale invasion and siege quickly comes to ahead, with the grobi attempting to cross the cities moat and scale its walls, whilst their siege machines inflict damage against the cities various structures. Theres even at some point an attempted invasion via the Lake of Echoes into the cities docks area, but its ultimately unsuccessful due to the efforts of the Corps and because grobi arent very well suited or adapted to navel combat. All this commotion awakens an emerald drake deep within the forest out of its seasonal hibernation, which causes trouble for the Grobi camps as well as being another issue that the corps need to be mindful of when doing their special ops missions to weaken the grobis siege via sabotage of their siege machines during the night, setting alight their camps when they sleeping and other various guerilla tactics, as well as counter raids of their own before the main forces can catch them. During all this, the corps get closer and closer to the grobis main siege camp, and discover a Grobi warlock as being the cause behind this uncharacteristic organization of the grobi, as well as the source of necromantic power that seems to be aiding the Grobi forces directly with the use of the undead. This grobi warlock seems to be in possession of an artifact that looks very similar to the one that was secured in the first act. Before the corps can deal with ending the siege however, the emerald drake attacks the city itself as well, and after causing some damage with its toxic gas breath, is repelled away wounded thanks to a combination of the cities militia and the corps who defended the city. Its then decided that the drake needs to be put down for good, and a hit squad is formed to track the wounded beast to its resting stop and to slay it once and for all before it can do even more damage. The hit squad then embarks to slay the drake, prompting them to travel into a deep and largely undocumented part of the deep southern forest. After traversing through the forest, fighting their way through other dangers of the forest both natural (like wolves) and otherworldly (like magical beasts such as owlbears, basilisks, gryphons  and other magical creatures) they come to the base of the eastern mountain range where the landscape changes from deep thick forests to hard and rocky mountains. The drake is resting in a valley situated in the middle of the forest and mountains, its cries of pain and blood trail leading it to a cave. There the corps decide on a plan of action to draw the drake out of the cave by smoking it out, and to then to ground it with mobile ballista targeting the wings, once its landed, the rest of the squad would then engage it in a mix of melee and magic and slay it. The smoking initially seems to work, but back fires when the toxic gas of the drakes breath causes the fire at the front of the cave to explode, temporarily disorienting the squad and stopping the ballista operators from firing at the drake as it bursts into the air, where it causes problems by doing fly bys on various members of the squad. eventually the operators get a good shot, and shread a wing of the drakes, causing it to fall to the ground further along in the valley, and thus prompting the rest of the squad to hot foot it to the crashed site to finish it off. Eventually they succeed and although wounded, are able to explore the dragons nest and bring back some choice treasures. Whilst this is all happening, simultaneously the other corps members start taking the offensive, weakening the grobis siege via the tactics used so far and eventually are able to perform a counter offensive to attack the grobi warlock at its base camp. This fight turns for the worse as the grobi warlock reveals themselves to be a Lesser Sinner and uses the power of their artifact to turn the dead bodies of fallen allies and enemies alike against the corps squad. They are able to vanquish this threat and finally engage in a one on one show down with the Lesser Sinner before finally defeating it by destroying its artifact  With this and most of the grobi forces broken or slain. However, the Lesser Sinner who was uncover within Grenzmark now uses the fact that theres noone in the city who can stop them from taking the secured artifact from act one does so, revealing its transformation and the betrayal before fleeing the city with the artifact and heading in what seems to be the location of the ruins from act one. The ending to this Act results in the Drake hit squad and the hit squad against the Grobi Warlock/ Lesser Sinner meeting back up i the city and clearing the rest of the grobi forces in the area, breaking the siege.
