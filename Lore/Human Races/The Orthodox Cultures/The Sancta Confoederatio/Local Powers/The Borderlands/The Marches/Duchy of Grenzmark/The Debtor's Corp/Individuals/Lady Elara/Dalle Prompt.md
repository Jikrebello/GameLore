Dalle Prompt
Create an image of Lady Elara, a character from a story set in a fantasy world. She is a noblewoman turned adventurer, combining elements of Victorian-era women's hunting attire with rugged, practical gear suited for her new life. Her attire includes:

- A dirty, muddy, armor-reinforced trench coat that speaks to her adventurous spirit.
- Knee-high leather boots, well-worn and practical, yet hinting at her noble past.
- A once fashionable corset, now scarred from battles and reinforced with metal, serving as both a reminder of her past and a piece of body armor.
- Discreet jewelry, including small earrings, rings, and a hidden necklace, integrating her noble heritage with her current life as an adventurer.
- Her long blonde hair is tied up in a messy bun, practical for her adventures yet a nod to her once-styled courtly appearance.
- She carries a rapier at her belt, alongside numerous throwing knives, ready for any threat.
- Her expression is one of determination, with a hint of the wit and irony that defines her personality.

This image should capture the essence of Lady Elara, showcasing her as a figure caught between two worlds - the refinement of her noble past and the rugged reality of her life as an adventurer.

Lady Elara, having navigated the tumultuous transition from highborn lady to resourceful adventurer, embodies a complex blend of attitudes, beliefs, and idiosyncrasies that make her a captivating and multifaceted character.
