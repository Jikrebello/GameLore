As Grenzmark stands besieged, an ancient protector of its lands, an Emerald Drake, awakens—its slumber disturbed by the tremors of war and dark magic suffusing the air. This formidable creature, once a guardian of nature's balance, now becomes an unpredictable force in the unfolding conflict, its wrath indiscriminate against friend and foe alike.

**The Initial Assault**

The Emerald Drake's awakening sends shockwaves through the ranks of both the Grobi and Grenzmark's defenders. Its first assault targets the city itself, where its toxic breath, a deadly miasma, wreaks havoc on the battlements and residential areas alike. The Corps and city militia, already stretched thin by the siege, scramble to mount a defense against this aerial threat. Through a combination of archery, magic, and sheer determination, they manage to repel the drake, though not without cost. The creature, wounded yet still formidable, retreats to the depths of the forest, leaving destruction in its wake.

**The Decision to Hunt**

Recognizing the Emerald Drake as a dire threat that cannot be left unchecked, the Debtor's Corps hastily assembles a specialized hit squad. This team, composed of the Corps' most skilled trackers, mages, and warriors, is tasked with a perilous mission: to find and eliminate the drake before it can attack again. Armed with weapons and magic designed to counter the drake's formidable defenses, they venture into the uncharted wilderness that borders the duchy.

**The Hunt Through the Wilderness**

The squad's journey is fraught with peril. The deep forest, untamed and ancient, hides not just the drake but other dangers as well—predators both natural and supernatural that view the squad as trespassers. Encounters with wolves, owlbears, and other magical creatures test the squad's resolve and skills, each battle honing them for the confrontation ahead.

**The Showdown in the Valley**

Guided by the drake's trail of blood and its pained cries, the squad finds their quarry in a secluded valley, a place where the dense forest gives way to the rugged beauty of the eastern mountains. The drake, seeking refuge in a cave, becomes the target of the squad's carefully laid trap. Their plan to smoke the drake out initially backfires spectacularly when the creature's toxic breath ignites the blaze at the cave's entrance, causing an explosion that disorients the hunters.

Undeterred, the squad regroups, adapting their strategy on the fly. A critical shot from their mobile ballista tears through one of the drake's wings, bringing the beast crashing down into the valley. The squad, seizing the opportunity, engages the drake on the ground. The battle is intense and harrowing, a testament to the drake's might and the squad's bravery.

**The Drake's Defeat**

In the end, the Emerald Drake falls, its reign of terror concluded by the combined might of the Debtor's Corps' finest. The squad, though victorious, bears the scars of their encounter, a solemn reminder of the cost of their duty. In the drake's nest, they uncover treasures long guarded by the creature, relics of a bygone era that speak to the ancient history of Grenzmark and its lands.

**Aftermath and Reflection**

As the squad makes its way back to Festungshalt, the fallen Emerald Drake serves as a stark symbol of the conflict's complexity and the unforeseen consequences of the dark forces at play. The mission, while a success, underscores the unpredictable nature of the battle for Grenzmark's soul and the challenges that lie ahead for the Debtor's Corps. The siege may have been the catalyst for the drake's awakening, but its involvement in the conflict reveals the deeper, more ancient layers of the struggle that engulfs the duchy.
