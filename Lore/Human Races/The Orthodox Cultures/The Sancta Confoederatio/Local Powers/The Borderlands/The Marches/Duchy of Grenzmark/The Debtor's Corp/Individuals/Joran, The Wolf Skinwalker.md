Joran, The Wolf Skinwalker

**Background:**

Joran hails from the formidable [[Ättar]] tribes, born under the sign of the Wolf Totem. From a young age, Joran exhibited the innate traits of his totem—exceptional endurance, heightened senses, and an unbreakable spirit. His life, deeply rooted in the traditions of his people, was one of harmony with the untamed forests of the southern wilds and unwavering devotion to [[Lunara Noctis]].

#### The Call of the Skinwalker:

Driven by a profound connection to his totem and a desire to protect his tribe from the ever-present threats of the Grobi and the harsh wilderness, Joran chose the path of the Skinwalker. His sacrifice to Lunara Noctis was significant, a memory of his first hunt, symbolizing his transition from boy to warrior. This offering granted him the ability to transform into a powerful wolf-man, embodying the apex of his totem's might.

- **Power and Peril**: Joran's transformations endowed him with unmatched prowess in battle, but each shift eroded a piece of his humanity, drawing him ever closer to the moontouched twilight.

#### Ensnarement by the Fraternitas:

The **Fraternitas Argentarius**, ever-expanding their reach, sought to harness the mystical powers of the Ättar for their own ends. Recognizing Joran's formidable abilities, they orchestrated events leading to his entrapment in a web of debt. Through manipulated trade deals and the exploitation of a moment of desperation within Joran's tribe, the Fraternitas secured leverage over him, binding him to their service under threat of severe repercussions for his people.

- **Reluctant Service**: Bound by duty and the manipulated contracts of the Fraternitas, Joran was coerced into joining the Debtor's Corp, his allegiance torn between his tribe's traditions and the obligations foisted upon him.

#### Skills and Abilities:

- **Totemic Transformation**: Joran's skinwalker form is that of a formidable wolf-man, granting him extraordinary strength, speed, and senses, coupled with the tactical acumen of his human intellect.
  
- **Spiritual Connection**: His deep bond with Lunara Noctis and the Wolf Totem allows him occasional insights and guidance, manifesting as instincts and visions that aid him in his path.

- **Warrior of the Wilds**: Joran is not only a master of combat but also an expert in survival, tracking, and guerrilla tactics, honed through years of defending his tribe's lands.

#### Journey in the Debtor's Corp:

In the Debtor's Corp, Joran finds himself in a strange land, fighting battles far removed from the forests of his home. Yet, he adapts, using his unique abilities to protect those who, like his tribe, are threatened by darkness. Each mission undertaken in the name of the Fraternitas is also a step towards securing the safety of his people, a balance he strives to maintain even as the call of the moontouched looms.

- **The Quest for Liberation**: Joran's ultimate goal is to free himself from the Fraternitas's control, to return to his tribe not as a servant of distant masters but as a protector, fully in command of his destiny and powers.

#### Conclusion

Joran's story is a poignant tale of sacrifice, duty, and the struggle for autonomy against the backdrop of mystical bonds and the machinations of power. As a wolf skinwalker of the Ättar, his journey through the ranks of the Debtor's Corp speaks to the resilience of the human spirit and the lengths to which one will go to protect home and heritage, even when faced with the erosion of self. In the Corp, he is a symbol of fierce loyalty and the haunting cost of power, a warrior caught between worlds, fighting for a freedom that seems as elusive as the moon's embrace.

For Joran, the Wolf Skinwalker from the Ättar tribes, his narrative within the broader conflict of the Duchy of Grenzmark weaves a tale of personal struggle, transformation, and the quest for freedom. His story arc, embedded within the seasonal framework of the main story, reflects his internal and external battles.

### Act 1: Autumn's Call

#### Setup
- **Introduction**: Joran arrives in Grenzmark under the shadow of obligation to the Fraternitas Argentarius, his prowess and unique abilities making him a valuable asset to the Debtor's Corps. Despite his formidable skills, he grapples with the constraints of his service, which chafe against the traditions and freedoms of his upbringing.
- **First Transformations**: Tasked with patrols and reconnaissance in the forests surrounding Festungshalt, Joran confronts Grobi scouts using his totemic transformation. These early encounters showcase his battle prowess but also hint at the personal cost of his power, as he struggles to maintain his humanity with each shift.

#### Conflict
- **The Artifact and the Grobi**: During a mission to recover an ancient artifact believed to be linked to the Adversary, Joran's ability to navigate and survive in the wilderness proves crucial. However, the discovery of the artifact, and its dark resonance with the powers he wields, forces him to confront the reality of the forces at play—far greater than mere Grobi incursions.
- **Ambush and Reflection**: A Grobi ambush, larger and more coordinated than any before, tests the Corps to its limits. Joran's leadership and ferocity turn the tide, but the aftermath leaves him questioning the nature of his servitude to the Fraternitas and the fate of his tribe should he fail to return.

#### Resolution
- **Return to Festungshalt**: Joran and the Corps return victorious but burdened with the knowledge of the artifact's ominous power. His actions earn him respect within the Corps, but the artifact's influence on his transformations becomes apparent, deepening his resolve to find a way to free himself from the Fraternitas's yoke.

### Act 2: Winter's Fury

#### Setup
- **Siege and Sacrifice**: As winter descends and the Grobi lay siege to Festungshalt, Joran's transformations become both a weapon against the encroaching darkness and a beacon of hope for the besieged city. The appearance of an Emerald Drake, roused from its slumber by the conflict, presents a new and deadly challenge.
- **Behind Enemy Lines**: In a pivotal mission, Joran uses his unique abilities to infiltrate Grobi lines, uncovering a plot to use the artifact to breach the city's defenses. The mission reveals the depth of his strategic mind and his unwavering commitment to the cause, even as it draws him closer to the edge of losing himself to his beastial nature.

#### Conflict
- **The Drake's Wrath**: Confronting the Emerald Drake requires Joran to push his transformations further than ever before, risking the final threads of his humanity for the sake of Grenzmark. The battle is a harrowing display of power and sacrifice, forging bonds of camaraderie and respect between Joran and his fellow Corps members.

#### Resolution
- **Breaking the Siege**: The defeat of the Drake and the breaking of the Grobi siege mark a turning point. Joran's actions have saved Festungshalt, but at a personal cost. The artifact's influence over him grows, hinting at a connection between his powers and the deeper darkness at play. The resolution of the siege sets the stage for a deeper exploration of the dungeons beneath Grenzmark, in search of answers and, possibly, salvation.

### Act 3: Spring's Awakening

#### Setup
- **The Dungeons Deep**: Spring brings a new mission: to delve into the dungeons beneath the Duchy, tracing the source of the undead uprising. For Joran, this journey is twofold—a quest to protect Grenzmark and a personal pilgrimage to confront the essence of his power and its ties to the Adversary.
- **Confrontation with the Lesser Sinners**: Deep within the dungeons, Joran and the Corps confront Lesser Sinners attempting to awaken a Sinner in the form of a Dragon. The battle tests Joran's resolve, his ability to lead, and his commitment to his totemic powers.

#### Climax
- **Sacrifice and Revelation**: The climax sees Joran making a crucial decision that defines his future. To thwart the Sinners' plans, he must either embrace the full extent of his transformation, risking becoming moontouched, or find a new strength within his human heart. His choice leads to a revelation about the nature of his bond to the Adversary and the possibility of breaking free from the Fraternitas's control.

#### Resolution
- **A New Dawn**: With the artifact destroyed and the immediate threat quelled, Joran finds a moment of peace. His sacrifices have not gone unnoticed, earning him a place of honor within the Corps and, possibly, a path back to his tribe. The resolution is bittersweet, with Joran standing on the threshold between two worlds, his destiny as a Skinwalker forever altered by his experiences in Grenzmark.

Joran's personal journey through the Duchy of Grenzmark is a tale of conflict, transformation, and the search for identity. It explores the cost of power and the meaning of freedom, set against the backdrop of a land besieged by darkness and strife.
