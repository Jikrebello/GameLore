As the vibrant hues of autumn begin to fade into the stark, monochromatic landscape of winter, the Duchy of Grenzmark braces itself for the season's unforgiving embrace. The Debtor's Corps, fresh from their harrowing encounter with the Grobi encampment and the subsequent recovery of the ominous artifact, shifts its focus towards ensuring the safety and security of the duchy through the cold months ahead.

**Eradicating the Grobi Threat**

The immediate aftermath of the assault on the Grobi encampment sees the Corps engaged in a systematic campaign to root out and disband the remaining Grobi forces scattered throughout the southern forest. Small squads, adept in guerrilla warfare, traverse the dense woodlands, dismantling any Grobi camps they find. These efforts are crucial not only to secure the duchy's borders but also to send a clear message to any Grobi survivors: Grenzmark will not tolerate their presence within its territories.

**Securing the Seasonal Villages**

Parallel to their campaign against the Grobi, the Corps undertakes the task of securing the seasonal villages dotting the landscape. These villages, vital to Grenzmark's agricultural and economic activities during the warmer months, must be properly secured to prevent any potential looting or squatting by Grobi stragglers or other opportunistic threats. The Corps assists in boarding up windows, reinforcing doors, and setting up simple, yet effective, warning systems for the villagers who will return when spring thaws the land.

**Winter Preparations and Training**

Beyond the physical preparations, the Corps also focuses on internal readiness. Training intensifies, with veterans sharing their knowledge of winter survival and combat tactics suited to the season's unique challenges. Workshops and drills become a common sight within the barracks and the surrounding areas, ensuring that every member of the Corps is prepared for the hardships and potential conflicts that winter may bring.

**The Artifact's Influence and Study**

The artifact, a source of dark fascination and concern, is secured in a specially prepared vault beneath the Corps' barracks. Its containment is a testament to the Corps' understanding of the threat it poses; however, the presence of the Infiltrator Lesser Sinner within their ranks complicates matters. Under the guise of aiding in the artifact's study, this Lesser Sinner subtly directs the research, seeking insights into harnessing its power and unraveling the secrets of the summoning ritual. Unbeknownst to the rest of the Corps, this manipulation serves a dual purpose: to empower the Infiltrator and to lay the groundwork for the ritual's completion.

**The Artifact as a Beacon**

Despite the Corps' efforts to contain and understand the artifact, its very existence within Festungshalt becomes a beacon to dark forces. Whispers of its recovery spread through shadowed channels, reaching the ears of those who serve the Adversary. The artifact's allure is not limited to the Lesser Sinners; it also attracts the attention of dark scholars, rogue mages, and cults devoted to the Adversary, all drawn by the promise of power it represents. The Corps finds itself guarding a Pandora's box of dark potential, the key to which lies in deciphering the artifact's mysteries before it can be exploited by their enemies.

### Conclusion

The preparations for winter in Grenzmark are marked by a dual focus on external security and internal readiness, overshadowed by the dark intrigue surrounding the secured artifact. The Debtor's Corps, vigilant and determined, stands ready to face the season's trials, even as the Infiltrator within their ranks moves their sinister agenda forward. The artifact, locked away yet influential, remains a potent symbol of the looming conflict, a reminder of the battles fought and those yet to come.
