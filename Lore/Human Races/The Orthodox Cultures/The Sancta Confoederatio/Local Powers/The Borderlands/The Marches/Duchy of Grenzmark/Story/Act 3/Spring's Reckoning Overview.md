As Grenzmark awakens from winter's siege to the promise of spring, a malignant shadow threatens to suffocate its nascent bloom. The stolen artifact's dark influence seeps deep into the land, heralding an undead uprising that challenges the very fabric of life in the duchy. The Debtor's Corps, scarred yet steadfast, rallies to confront the encroaching darkness, embarking on a perilous journey that will determine the fate of Grenzmark.

**[[The Undead Uprising]]**

The land's rebirth is marred by the emergence of undead armies, their skeletal ranks spilling forth from ancient ruins, driven by the Lesser Sinner's will. The Corps divides its strength, with squads dispatched to safeguard the seasonal villages and stem the tide of the undead. Sanctification missions become a desperate race against time, as church clergy and Corps members work to sever the dark nexus points fueling the undead's relentless advance.

**[[Descent into the Ancient Temple]]**

Guided by grim determination and the need to end the threat at its source, the Corps uncovers the entrance to a deeper, unexplored expanse beneath the original ruin. This underground temple, a vestige of ancient communion with the Adversary, holds the key to stopping the Lesser Sinner's plot. The architecture's transformation, from rudimentary ruins to eldritch complexity, signifies the Corps' descent into the heart of darkness.

**[[The Final Battle]]**

In the temple's innermost sanctum, the Corps faces the Lesser Sinner amidst a ritual to summon the Sinner Dragon. The confrontation is brutal, a testament to the artifact's corrupting power and the Lesser Sinner's determination. The Corps' tactical destruction of the ritual's focal points, coupled with fierce combat, culminates in the artifact's destruction and the Lesser Sinner's demise. The subsequent collapse of the chamber, a symbolic purging of the temple's corruption, marks a narrow escape for the Corps, whose actions have averted catastrophe at the brink of the dragon's emergence.

**[[Aftermath and Renewal]]**

The artifact's destruction brings a sudden, eerie calm to Grenzmark. The undead scourge dissipates, leaving the Corps and the duchy's inhabitants to reckon with the aftermath. The victory is pyrrhic, shadowed by the losses endured and the revelation of betrayal within their ranks. Yet, in the wake of darkness, Grenzmark finds new strength in unity and a renewed vigilance against the shadows.

**Unraveled Threads and Future Tales**

- **The Legacy of the Lesser Sinners**: The defeat of the Lesser Sinners does not eradicate the Adversary's influence from Grenzmark. Hidden relics, cults, and corrupted beasts remain, ensuring the Corps' continued vigilance.
- **Rebuilding Trust**: The betrayal by one of their own leaves a deep wound within the Debtor's Corps and Festungshalt's leadership. Rebuilding trust and ensuring such a breach never occurs again become paramount.
- **Exploration of the Ancient Temple**: The ruins, now partially collapsed, still hold secrets and ancient knowledge. The Corps may undertake expeditions to uncover and secure these remnants, ensuring they do not fall into the wrong hands.
- **External Threats**: With the undead uprising quelled, Grenzmark must also turn its attention to external threats. The Grobi, though leaderless, remain a scattered menace, and neighboring realms may view the duchy's recent turmoil as an opportunity.
- **The Adversary's Reach**: The revelation of the Adversary's lingering influence in the world suggests a broader conflict beyond Grenzmark's borders. Allies and enemies, drawn by the events of the siege and the uprising, could introduce new dynamics and challenges to the duchy.

### Conclusion

Spring's reckoning leaves Grenzmark changed, its people tempered by the trials of winter and the darkness they've overcome. The Debtor's Corps, hailed as heroes, faces the future with a mix of wariness and resolve, aware that the battle against the Adversary's legacy is far from over. New alliances, challenges, and adventures await, as Grenzmark navigates its place in a world where ancient powers stir and the balance between light and darkness remains ever precarious.
