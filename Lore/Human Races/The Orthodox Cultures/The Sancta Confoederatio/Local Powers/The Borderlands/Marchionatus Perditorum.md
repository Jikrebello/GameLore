The **Marchionatus Perditorum**, a sprawling expanse of dense forests and rugged terrain, serves as the enigmatic frontier of the Sancta Confoederatio. This sparsely populated buffer zone, nestled on the southernmost borders of the Confederation, is a land steeped in mystery and ancient lore, where the remnants of old battles and forgotten civilizations whisper secrets of power and magic. Its inhabitants, a hardy and resilient folk, are descendants of exiles, refugees, and veterans of border skirmishes, who have adapted to the harsh conditions and the constant threat from beyond the Confederation's boundaries. The Marchionatus is characterized by its fiercely independent petty kingdoms, border towns, and colonies, each governed by leaders skilled in the arts of guerrilla warfare and reconnaissance, making the region the Confederation's first line of defense against external threats.
