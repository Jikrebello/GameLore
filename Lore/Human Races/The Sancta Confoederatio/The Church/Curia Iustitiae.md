- **Role and Authority:**
     - Acts as the highest legal authority within the empire, overseeing major legal disputes, especially those involving church law or conflicts between secular kingdoms.
    - Its decisions are considered final and binding, especially in matters where local secular laws intersect with church doctrines.
- **Structure:**
     - Composed of high-ranking clergy members, legal scholars, and occasionally appointed secular judges.
    - Divided into various chambers or courts, each specializing in different aspects of law (e.g., civil, criminal, canonical).

- **Functioning:**
     - Reviews and adjudicates cases that have significant religious, moral, or political implications.
    - Ensures that local laws in various kingdoms adhere to the overarching moral and ethical principles of the church.
    - Acts as an appellate court for disputes unresolved or inadequately addressed at the local level.

- **Interaction with Local Kingdoms:**
     - Respects the autonomy of local kingdoms in managing their internal affairs but intervenes in cases that challenge the church’s doctrines or the empire’s unity.
     - Provides legal guidance and interpretation of church laws to local courts.


- **Relation with the Ordinem Sancti Bellatoris:**
     - In cases involving members of the Ordinem Sancti Bellatoris, the Judicial Branch may conduct special hearings, considering the unique nature of their service and the divine laws they abide by.
     - Coordinates with the military order to enforce judicial decisions when necessary, especially in matters of heresy, high crimes, or in executing mandates in lawless or contested regions.

### Leadership and Election Process

#### Clerical Leadership
- **Selection of Religious Leaders:** 
  - High-ranking clergy, such as bishops and cardinals, are typically appointed by the church's supreme leader (analogous to a Pope or Patriarch). 
  - For this supreme leader's selection, a conclave of senior clergy might convene, perhaps involving divine guidance rituals to ensure the chosen individual aligns with the faith's tenets.

#### Secular Leadership
- **Local Secular Lords:** 
  - Local lords or rulers of the smaller kingdoms are usually hereditary positions or elected by local nobility or assemblies, depending on the kingdom's traditions.
  - The church may have advisory or approval roles, especially in kingdoms closely aligned with the church.

#### Mutual Influence
- **Church and Secular Powers:** 
  - The church exerts influence over local rulers through spiritual authority and political alliances. In turn, influential secular lords may have sway in church matters, particularly in regions where the church's presence is intertwined with local governance.

### Handling Local Disputes and Kingdom Relations

#### Local Kingdom Autonomy
- **Casus Belli and Local Disputes:** 
  - Local kingdoms handle their internal affairs and disputes independently, but they are expected to adhere to the overarching principles laid down by the church.
  - For declaring war (casus belli), kingdoms might require sanctioning or blessing from the church, especially if the conflict involves other church-aligned states.

#### Church’s Oversight and Intervention
- **Resolution of Disputes:** 
  - The Clericus Imperium, particularly its Judicial Branch, steps in when disputes involve church law, major ethical concerns, or risks to the empire's unity.
  - Mediation and legal hearings are preferred, but the church can exert pressure through sanctions or mobilize the Ordinem Sancti Bellatoris in extreme cases.

- **Land and Title Disputes:** 
  - The church often acts as a mediator or final arbiter in disputes over land and titles, especially when such disputes threaten the stability of the region.
  - Decisions are made considering historical claims, local laws, and the wider interests of the church and the empire.

#### Church’s Role as a Central Authority
- **Balancing Power:** 
  - The Clericus Imperium balances its role as a central authority with respect for local traditions and laws. Its primary goal is to maintain unity and uphold religious and moral standards.
  - The church may use its influence to foster alliances, settle disputes, and ensure that secular rulers govern justly and in alignment with church doctrines.

### Conclusion

The internal structure of the Clericus Imperium and its interaction with local secular powers is a blend of hierarchical church authority and feudal political dynamics. The church holds significant sway over spiritual and moral matters, influencing secular governance through a combination of soft power and direct intervention when necessary. This system opens up a wide array of possibilities for political maneuvering, alliances, conflicts, and intricate storytelling in your game, allowing players to engage deeply with the world's socio-political fabric.
