- **Church Leadership:** The supreme religious leader (akin to a Pope or Patriarch) wields substantial influence, guiding moral and spiritual matters across the Confederation.
- **Advisory and Mediation Role:** Church officials often serve as advisors to secular rulers and mediators in disputes between states, maintaining the balance of power and unity within the Confederation.

- **Role of Military Orders:** These orders protect the Confederation's borders, enforce church edicts, and engage in expeditions and crusades as directed by church leadership.
