### Daily Lives of Inhabitants

In **Ducatus Altus Silvarum**, the daily life of its inhabitants is closely intertwined with the vast, ancient forests that dominate the landscape. The people here live in harmony with the land, practicing sustainable woodcraft and hunting, ensuring that the forests thrive for generations to come. Villages and towns are often built with an eye for preserving the natural beauty and integrity of their surroundings, using materials that blend seamlessly with the forest.

Families pass down traditions of woodworking, herbalism, and hunting from one generation to the next. The deep cultural reverence for nature is evident in their daily rituals and the celebrations that mark the changing of the seasons, often invoking the protection and blessings of the ancient spirits believed to inhabit the woods. Children are taught from a young age to navigate and respect the forest, learning the skills needed to live in this verdant environment. 

Whilst the forests closest to the towns and villages are for the most part safe and free from major predators and threats and offer good game and foraging opportunities, the deeper one goes into the forest the darker it gets, and the bigger, more dangerous and aggressive the creatures inside become. The role of the rangers and their scouts is therefore twofold, to protect the duchy from threats both outside and inside. 

### Machinations of Its Leaders

The leaders of the **Ducatus Altus Silvarum** are as much stewards of the land as they are its rulers. They work closely with the elite corps of rangers to manage the forests, protect against poachers, exterminate predators/ monsters roaming outside their marked territories and manage general maintenance and the balance between human needs and the natural world. The ducal court is known for its councils, where leaders discuss issues ranging from environmental preservation to defense and trade, and sometimes in secret seek guidance from the ancient lore of the land.

Politically, the duchy navigates its relations with neighboring states and the Sanctum Sedes Divinitatis with a focus on autonomy and the preservation of their traditions. There is a delicate balance between cooperating with the broader mandates of the Confederation and protecting the unique way of life that defines the duchy.

### Secrets Hidden Within Its Lands

The forests of the **Ducatus Altus Silvarum** are ancient and deep, hiding many secrets. Rumors tell of hidden groves where the spirits of nature are especially strong, offering blessings or curses to those who find them. There are also tales of secret paths that lead to realms where the forest spirits reign, inaccessible to all but those chosen by the woods themselves.

The deeper ones travels into the forests, the more the forest changes from pleasant and hospitable into dark and dreadful, with normal creatures taking on more aggressive, dire versions of themselves. There are also ruins of ancient Menhir encampments, ruins from failed invasion's from the Wildlands into our Material realm.

Some believe that the duchy guards ancient artifacts and relics connected to the old spirits, kept in secret locations known only to the ducal family and their closest advisors. These artifacts are said to have the power to protect the duchy from harm by harnessing the creatures deep inside the forests.

There are also rumor's whispered that theres a secret, hidden inner circle within the duchy's leadership and the rangers corps that still venerate the pagan Old Gods (the Menhir) alongside the Orthodoxy of the church, participating in pagan rituals, hidden in the secrecy of these dark forests     

### Relationships Between the States and Church Influence

The **Ducatus Altus Silvarum** maintains a complex relationship with the other states of the Confederation and the Sanctum Sedes Divinitatis. While the duchy values its membership in the Confederation for the protection and trade opportunities it offers, there is a constant tension between the duchyâ€™s pagan-like reverence for nature and the monotheistic doctrines of the church. This has led to a form of syncretism in some areas, where the least inoffensive of the ancient practices are woven into the fabric of the church's rituals, albeit with a careful avoidance of direct conflict with church doctrine.

The duchy's leaders often find themselves in diplomatic negotiations to preserve their traditions and autonomy, especially when Confederation-wide decrees from the Sanctum Sedes Divinitatis threaten to encroach on their way of life. Their elite corps of rangers, while primarily focused on protecting the duchy, sometimes serve in broader military campaigns of the Confederation, showcasing their loyalty but also ensuring the duchy's interests are respected.
