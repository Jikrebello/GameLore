The sense of mystery surrounding the land, with its ancient ruins and tales of forbidden magic, imbues the local culture with a mix of reverence and caution for the unknown.

### Machinations of Its Leaders

Leadership within the **Marchionatus Perditorum** is decentralized, with each petty kingdom, border town, and colony operating with a degree of independence under the broader allegiance to the Confederation. Local lords, chieftains, and elected councils govern their territories, focusing on defense, self-sufficiency, and the maintenance of the March's status as a buffer zone.

These leaders are skilled in guerrilla warfare and reconnaissance, often organizing patrols and training militias to defend against incursions from beyond the Confederation's borders.

Their role as the first line of defense against external threats often grants them a degree of leverage, allowing them to negotiate for military and economic support.
