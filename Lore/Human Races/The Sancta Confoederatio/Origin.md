lets expand and go deeper into the origins of the Sancta Confoederatio. Originally they came from the Jirahar, who lived according to the Law given to the Great Prophet after escaping slavery from the giants in the land north, crossing the Great Glass Desert. At that point, humanity was united under a single peoples, that being the Jirahar. However, after the Great Prophet died, humanity split over who and how they should be lead, with large groups of the Jirahar peoples foregoing the Law over arguments on how it should be interpreted and followed, and after much infighting, large groups left and decided to strike it out on their own in this new and promised land. That then left the people who stayed according to the Law to become the Jirahar, and they started settling into the promised southern lands, fighting with the other now "pagan" peoples. 

After a decent amount of time had passed, the Jirahar added to the Law with their own laws, trying to fill in the gaps and make sense of the Laws in more practical ways of understanding.

Eventually the Redeemer came, a man that claimed to be the physical incarnate of the Lord in the flesh, and started to gain followers and teach the Law with new understanding, coming in to officially complete it. This angered the established orthodoxy that had developed in the Jirahar clergy, and they fought with the Redeemer and his growing number of followers.
