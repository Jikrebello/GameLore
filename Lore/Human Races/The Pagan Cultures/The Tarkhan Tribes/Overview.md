### [[Origin]]

The Tarkhan Tribes trace their origins to the legendary figure of Khorum Khan, a unifier who rose from the vastness of the steppes. Legend has it that Khorum was chosen by the Idol of Wrath, "[[The Fury]]", and guided by the celestial insights of a lesser-known Menhir entity embodying the spirit of the steppe. Through a combination of visionary leadership, unparalleled horsemanship, and strategic marriages, Khorum united the disparate tribes under a single banner, laying the foundation for a culture that would dominate the steppes for centuries.

### [[Location and Environment]]

The Tarkhan Tribes inhabit the expansive steppes, a vast grassland stretching across the horizon, interspersed with rugged mountains and wide rivers. This environment, harsh and unforgiving, has shaped the Tarkhans into a hardy and mobile people, adept at navigating the challenges of their homeland. The steppes provide ample grazing for their horses, a central pillar of Tarkhan life, while the rivers offer resources crucial for their nomadic lifestyle.

### [[Culture and Society]]

Tarkhan society is fundamentally nomadic, organized around the family and clan structures, with loyalty to the tribe superseding all. Their culture venerates the horse, not just as a tool of war but as a companion and symbol of freedom. The Tarkhans are known for their exceptional horsemanship, a skill taught from a young age. Social status is often determined by one's abilities in riding, archery, and strategy, as well as one's contribution to the welfare of the tribe. Hospitality, honor, and the bonds of kinship and oath are the pillars of their societal values.

### [[Political Structure]]

The Tarkhans are led by a Khan, a ruler chosen through a combination of hereditary right and merit, often demonstrated through martial prowess and leadership skills. The Khan's authority is supported by a council of elders and notable warriors from various clans, ensuring that all major decisions reflect the will and welfare of the tribes as a whole. This structure allows for a degree of flexibility and adaptability in governance, vital for a nomadic people.

### [[Economy]]

The economy of the Tarkhan Tribes is primarily based on pastoralism, with horse breeding, cattle, and sheep herding forming the backbone of their livelihoods. Trade, both within the tribes and with settled neighbors, plays a crucial role, with the Tarkhans exchanging horses, leather goods, and furs for agricultural products, metalwork, and luxury items from afar. Raiding and tribute from conquered peoples also contribute to their economy.

### [[Military Organization]]

The Tarkhan military is renowned for its mobility and effectiveness, with every member of the tribe trained to ride and fight from horseback. Their primary military units are highly mobile horse archers, capable of executing complex maneuvers on the battlefield. The Tarkhans employ a combination of hit-and-run tactics and feigned retreats, exploiting the mobility and endurance of their horses to outmaneuver and exhaust their enemies.

### [[Judicial System]]

Justice among the Tarkhans is swift and often harsh, based on customary laws passed down through generations. Disputes are settled by the Khan or local leaders, with an emphasis on restitution and compensation to the wronged party. For more severe crimes, punishments can include exile, physical punishment, or death. Honor and reputation play a crucial role in the Tarkhan judicial process, with the loss of honor considered a fate worse than death.

### [[Religious Beliefs and Practices]]

The Tarkhans practice a form of animism, worshiping the spirits of the land, sky, and their ancestors, alongside a reverence for The Fury and the steppe spirit Menhir. Their religious practices involve offerings, rituals to honor the spirits and ancestors, and shamanistic ceremonies led by spiritual leaders who communicate with the spirit world. The horse, as a symbol of the steppe, holds a sacred place in their rituals.

### [[Cultural Expressions]]

Tarkhan cultural expressions are deeply intertwined with their nomadic lifestyle and the natural world. Storytelling, epic poetry, and music are vital, with traditional instruments and throat singing recounting the deeds of heroes and the history of the tribes. Craftsmanship focuses on practicality and beauty, with intricate leatherwork, metalwork, and textile arts, such as felt making, being highly prized.

### [[Challenges and Conflicts]]

The Tarkhans face challenges from environmental pressures, such as harsh winters and droughts, which threaten their herds and way of life. Internally, the balance of power between clans and within the broader tribal confederation requires careful management to prevent conflict. Externally, expansionist ambitions and the defense of their territories against neighboring states and other nomadic groups present ongoing challenges. Balancing their traditional nomadic lifestyle with the pressures of a changing world, including settled societies' encroachment and the allure of sedentary life, remains a constant endeavor for the Tarkhan Tribes.

The Tarkhan Tribes, with their rich cultural heritage and formidable presence on the steppe, stand as a testament to the enduring spirit and resilience of nomadic warrior peoples, carving out a legacy that blends the fierce independence of the Huns with the strategic acumen of the Mongols.
