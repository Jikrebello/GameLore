Expanding on the concept of ghouls under the patronage of The Devourer deepens the exploration of gluttony's themes, providing a vivid narrative of consumption, decay, and the insatiable hunger that drives these creatures. Ghouls, in this context, are not just scavengers of the dead but pivotal figures in the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, embodying the darker aspects of desire and need.

### The Ecology of Ghouls in The Devourer's Domain

Ghouls occupy a unique niche within The Devourer's realm, acting as both custodians and consumers. Their presence ensures that nothing is wasted, yet their existence is a constant reminder of the cost of excess and the eternal hunger that drives all beings.

- **Graveyards and Crypts**: Sacred to The Devourer, these are the primary domains of ghouls. They are drawn to the remnants of life, feasting on the decay to sustain themselves. These places become centers of power for The Devourer, where the veil between life and death is thinnest, and the ghouls' feasting becomes a form of worship.
  
- **Battlefields**: Sites of mass death and destruction are banquet halls for ghouls. Here, they consume not just the physical remains but also the residual essence of violence and despair, growing stronger with each battle's aftermath they clean.

### The Hierarchy of Hunger

Within the ranks of ghouls, there exists a hierarchy based on age, power, and the ability to consume more potent sources of energy. Older ghouls, having fed upon countless corpses and absorbed the essence of death for centuries, command respect and fear.

- **Elders of Decay**: The oldest among ghouls, who have consumed thousands of corpses and absorbed the despair and darkness of countless souls, becoming powerful beings within The Devourer's realm. They often possess abilities that transcend mere physical consumption, able to invoke decay and desolation with a mere glance.
  
- **Scavengers of the Silent**: Younger ghouls, still eager and less discerning in their hunger. They roam the outskirts of human settlements and battlefields, ever searching for more to consume. They represent the base level of hunger, where quantity often overshadows the quality or significance of the feast.

### The Rituals of Consumption

Ghouls partake in macabre rituals that honor The Devourer, turning their act of consumption into a sacred rite that transcends mere survival.

- **Feasts of the Fallen**: On nights when the moon is new, ghouls gather in graveyards to share their findings in a grotesque communion, consuming the dead in a ritual that reaffirms their place in The Devourer's order.
  
- **The March of Mourners**: A procession of ghouls that follows major battles or plagues, where they march solemnly across the lands they've cleansed of death. This march is both a celebration of their feast and a mourning of the endless cycle of hunger and death they are bound to.

### Influence Beyond The Realm

Ghouls, under The Devourer's influence, serve as a bridge between the living and the dead, reminding all of the inevitability of death and the natural cycle of consumption and renewal. Their presence in the material world is a warning against gluttony and excess, showing that hunger, when left unchecked, can lead to a life devoid of meaning, filled only with the pursuit of the next meal.

- **Guardians of The Cycle**: In a twisted sense, ghouls ensure that nothing is wasted, that every death feeds new life, albeit in a dark reflection of natural cycles. They remind the living to cherish their time and to live with purpose, lest they end up merely fuel for another's hunger.

Through these expanded elements, ghouls under The Devourer's patronage become complex figures within the lore, serving as reminders of the balance between life and death, the cost of unchecked desires, and the dark hunger that lies at the heart of all beings, waiting to be awakened or appeased.

### The Great Ghoul Cities

Beneath the surface of the Material realm lie sprawling necropolises, cities of the dead and the undead, where ghouls have built an entire civilization in the embrace of darkness. These cities are a grotesque mirror of the world above, with their own hierarchies, rules, and cultures, all centered around the worship of The Devourer and the cycle of consumption.

- **Necropolis of Nihil**: The largest of the ghoul cities, built around the ruins of an ancient civilization that fell victim to a plague of ghoul fever. Its architecture is a mix of the beautiful and the macabre, with bone structures and crypts repurposed into homes and public spaces.
  
- **The Warrens of Woe**: A labyrinthine city known for its complex tunnels and catacombs. It serves as the breeding ground for ghouls, where those infected with ghoul fever are brought to transform. The Warrens are also where the Elders of Decay conduct their rituals and where the Feasts of the Fallen are most grandiose.
  
- **The Dusk Barrows**: A city suspended from the ceilings of vast caverns, known for its eerie beauty. It's here that the Scavengers of the Silent are trained, learning to navigate the upper world to bring back bodies and treasures to sustain their society.

### The Process of Becoming Ghouls: Ghoul Fever

Ghoul fever is a dreaded disease, transmitted by the bite of a ghoul. It is both a curse and a sacrament within ghoul society, representing the literal consumption of one's past life and the rebirth into a new existence under The Devourer's shadow.

- **Symptoms and Transformation**: The fever begins with an insatiable hunger, quickly followed by physical decay. The victim's mind becomes consumed with thoughts of hunger and death, leading to madness if the transformation is resisted. Within days, the victim dies, only to rise again as a ghoul, their first act of consciousness often to consume the flesh of the dead, sealing their fate as a servant of The Devourer.
  
- **The Ritual of Rebirth**: In ghoul cities, those undergoing transformation are often brought to sacred sites, where rituals are performed to ease their passage into undeath. These rituals are both a welcome and a binding, ensuring the newly risen ghouls accept their place in society and their devotion to The Devourer.

### Influence Beyond The Realm and Interaction with the Material World

Ghouls and their cities, while hidden, have a significant impact on the Material realm. They are the boogeymen of folklore, the monsters that lurk in the dark, a constant threat that drives humans to protect their dead and fortify their cities against the night.

- **The Cycle of Fear and Fascination**: Tales of ghoul cities and the transformation into such beings inspire both horror and a macabre fascination in the Material realm. They serve as a stark reminder of what lies waiting in the embrace of The Devourer for those who succumb to ghoul fever.
  
- **The Guardians of the Cycle**: Despite their horrifying nature, ghouls and their cities play a crucial role in the world's ecosystem. They prevent the spread of disease by consuming the dead and occasionally cull populations to prevent overgrowth, serving as dark stewards of the natural order.

The great ghoul cities and the process of transformation through ghoul fever enrich the lore of The Devourer's domain, providing a tangible connection between the themes of consumption, death, and the cycle of life and decay. They embody the complex relationship between the living and the dead, serving as a grim reminder of the costs of excess and the inevitable end that awaits all beings.
