Hobgoblins are either born as full-fledged Hobgoblins or emerge as grown goblins with an abundance of food. They are bigger and stronger than Goblins and are the closest match physically and mentally to the average human. Although only second weakest out of all Grobi, they make up for it in being arguably the smartest compared to the other sub-groups and the most capable in terms of technology, warfare arms and armaments an even a basic form of savage magic called Voodoo. Most Grobi warbands consist of majority Hobgoblin born rank and file soldiers with Goblins used as scouts and cannon fodder and being supplemented by Orc and Ogre shock troops.

Hobgoblin culture is focused around the military as its only with a decent military and training of soldiers that they can forage and hunt for food that sustains them. It is usually during this point that various tribes will develop and fight among each other for control of food and resources, with the successful war chiefs and generals being able to eat enough food to grow into Orcs
