Orcs only appear in successful Hobgoblin and Goblin warbands as the amount of food needed to become them only comes from successful group work to collect food. Growing into an Orc turns a Hobgoblin into a powerful killing machine, taller than the average human by half a metre to a metre taller and weighing double to triple the weight of an average human male. Of course, the same thing that applies to Hobgoblins and Goblins applies to Hobgoblins and Orcs, and “grown into” Orcs can reverse back to Hobgoblins and can also breed true Orcs with other Orcs.

An Orc can easily fight up to 3 human men at once without an issue due to their strength, size and speed. As a result of eating as much food as they need to maintain their bodies, born Orcs spend most of their time fighting, eating or sleeping whilst “grown into” Orcs are the heads of the Hobgoblin warbands as war chiefs and Generals and are much more dangerous due to their intellect and strategy that came from their Hobgoblin origins.
