The Grobi, a race characterized by their voracious hunger and adaptive physiology, are a major force in the world. This race is divided into four main groups, each with unique physical and intellectual traits that are influenced by their diet and environmental factors.

#### Origins of Transformation
- **Cursed Descent**: The Grobi's origins can be traced back to a mass transformation, a curse unleashed by The Fury upon humans who once worshipped or invoked its power with reckless abandon. This curse was both a gift and a punishment, granting them strength and resilience but at the cost of their humanity and peace.
  
- **Environmental Influence**: Living in areas suffused with The Fury's essence—battlefields, sites of massacres, or ancient cursed grounds—accelerated their transformation, adapting their bodies and minds to embody aspects of wrath.

#### [[Goblins]]
- **Basic Characteristics:** Small, agile, and resilient, goblins are the most basic form of Grobi. They are roughly the size of human children and are known for their hardiness and rapid breeding.
- **Survival Tactics:** Goblins can consume almost anything for sustenance, including decaying matter. They are opportunistic, preferring ambushes and overwhelming numbers in combat.
- **Metabolism and Regeneration:** Goblins have a remarkable ability to regenerate from severe injuries quickly, thanks to their efficient metabolism.
- **Transformation:** With sufficient food, goblins can grow into hobgoblins. If a grown hobgoblin cannot maintain its food intake, it reverts to its goblin form.

#### [[Hobgoblins]]
- **Development:** Hobgoblins are either born as full-fledged members of their kind or are goblins that have grown due to abundant food. They match humans in size and intellect.
- **Culture and Warfare:** Hobgoblin society is militaristic, focusing on foraging and hunting for sustenance. They are known for their use of basic weaponry, tactics, and a form of savage magic known as Voodoo.
- **Role in Grobi Warbands:** They form the backbone of Grobi armies, supplemented by goblins and stronger Grobi like orcs and ogres.
- **Advancement to Orc:** Successful Hobgoblin war leaders may become orcs if they can secure enough food.

#### [[Orcs]]
- **Emergence:** Orcs arise in successful Hobgoblin groups, requiring substantial food intake. They are significantly larger and stronger than humans.
- **Abilities:** Capable of overpowering multiple human adversaries, orcs are formidable in battle.
- **Intellect and Leadership:** While natural-born orcs focus on fighting and eating, those transformed from hobgoblins often lead warbands due to their strategic capabilities.

#### [[Ogres]]
- **Size and Strength:** Ogres are gigantic, towering up to three or four meters tall, with a correspondingly massive weight.
- **Intellectual Decline:** At this stage, Grobi sacrifice intelligence for size and strength, becoming driven primarily by their need to consume vast amounts of food.
- **Speculation of Further Stages:** There are rumors of an even larger, almost mythical fifth stage of Grobi development, but such creatures have not been confirmed by human encounters.

### Cultural and Societal Impact
- **Threat to Human Settlements:** The Grobi are a constant threat to human communities, particularly small towns and villages, which can be completely consumed by a Grobi attack.
- **Dynamic Growth:** The unique ability of Grobi to grow and advance into more formidable forms with sufficient food intake makes them an escalating threat in warfare.
- **Myth and Fear:** The Grobi are subjects of human myth and fear, often portrayed as an unstoppable force that grows stronger with each victory.

### Conclusion
The Grobi, with their unique physiological and societal characteristics, represent a dynamic and ever-evolving threat in this world. Their ability to grow and adapt based on their diet and success in combat makes them a uniquely challenging adversary for any human force. This race, with its distinct stages and societal structures, adds a rich and complex layer to the world's ecology and conflict dynamics.

### The Grobi: A Seasonal Scourge

#### Spring and Summer: The Time of Expansion
- **Growth**: With the thawing of the frozen tundra and the abundance of the warmer months, the Grobi experience a period of rapid growth and expansion. Food is plentiful, allowing goblins to grow into hobgoblins, and in turn, some into orcs and ogres. The Grobi hoards swell in number, bolstered by births and transformations.
  
- **Expansion**: Driven by their burgeoning numbers and the instinctual push from The Fury to claim and conquer, Grobi warbands venture further from their homelands. They explore, raid, and sometimes establish outposts in the lush territories that border their icy realms.

#### Autumn: The Prelude to Desperation
- **Preparation**: As the days shorten and the chill returns, the Grobi begin to feel the pressure of the approaching scarcity. This time is marked by frenzied activity: hoarding food, skirmishing with neighboring factions for resources, and consolidating power within their ranks.
  
- **Decline Begins**: The weakest among the Grobi, unable to secure enough sustenance, start to revert to their lesser forms. The social hierarchy becomes more pronounced as the struggle for resources intensifies.

#### Winter: The Descent into Survival
- **Migration and Invasion**: As the frozen tundra reclaims their homeland, the Grobi are forced to migrate northwards into human lands. This migration is a desperate quest for survival, driving the Grobi to raid human settlements aggressively.
  
- **Conflict with Humanity**: Winter becomes a season of vigilance and defense for the human settlements on the borderlands. The cold months bring not only the harshness of winter but also the threat of Grobi warbands, hungry and relentless.

- **Implosion**: The lack of resources during the harsh winter months leads to internal strife within the Grobi ranks. Fights over food and power are common, and the hoard's size drastically decreases due to infighting, starvation, and clashes with humans.

### Cultural and Mythological Impact

- **A Cycle of Fear and Resilience**: The seasonal movements of the Grobi become deeply ingrained in the lore and culture of the borderland communities. Winter preparations include fortifying defenses and stockpiling resources, not just for the cold, but in anticipation of the Grobi raids.

- **Legends and Strategies**: Over generations, humans develop strategies, legends, and even festivals around the Grobi's seasonal threat. Heroes and battles are commemorated, and strategies for repelling the Grobi are passed down through stories and military training.

- **A Dance with Nature**: For the Grobi, their life cycle tied to the seasons becomes a sacred rhythm, a testament to their resilience and adaptability. Their shamans and leaders interpret the changes in the seasons as signs and omens, guiding their movements and strategies in a perpetual dance with the forces of nature.

This seasonal dynamic introduces a layer of predictability to the Grobi threat, allowing for strategic planning and preparation by human defenders. However, it also underscores the tragic nature of the Grobi, driven by forces beyond their control to wage a never-ending battle for survival. The annual cycle of growth and decline paints the Grobi not just as mindless monsters, but as a deeply integrated part of the world's natural and supernatural ecosystem, forever bound to the cycle of seasons and the wrath of their creation.
