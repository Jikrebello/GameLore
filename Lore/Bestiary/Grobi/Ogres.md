If an Orc is ever able to consume enough food to grow into an Ogre, then it is truly a sight to behold. These literal giants tower 3 or even 4 metres above an average human and weigh close to a ton. At this point they reach a critical point, and become the least intelligent of all Grobi as their insatiable hunger forces them to devote all their time and energy to eat almost half their own body weight every other day or so and sleeping. Ogres can breed with other Ogres to breed true Ogres, and many have speculated that there is another almost mythological 5th subrace of Grobi giant that has yet to be encountered by humans.
