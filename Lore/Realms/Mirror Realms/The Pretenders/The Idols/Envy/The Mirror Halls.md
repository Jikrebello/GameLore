### General Layout of The Mirror Halls

- **The Entrance of Desires**: A grand hall where visitors first encounter mirrors that show them not as they are but as they wish to be, setting the tone for the realm's seductive and misleading nature.
- **Corridors of Comparison**: Twisting paths lined with mirrors that distort and exaggerate, showing one's peers in positions of power, wealth, or happiness, igniting the flames of envy and competition.
- **Chamber of Lost Reflections**: A vast, dimly lit room filled with mirrors that do not reflect the present but possible futures, each more tantalizing and unreachable than the last, fueling a hunger for what might never be.

### Points of Interest

- **The Garden of Forking Paths**: An outdoor space within the realm, seemingly offering a respite from the mirrors. However, each path taken shows a different outcome of the walker's life, illustrating how different choices could lead to the fulfillment of their envies or their downfall.
- **Hall of Echoed Whispers**: This area amplifies the whispered doubts and insecurities of visitors, reflecting not images but voices that suggest betrayal, underscoring the destructive nature of envy.
- **The Pool of Narcissus**: A clear, reflective pool that, instead of showing one's reflection, shows the viewer in the shadow of their rivals, diminishing their achievements and magnifying their failures, a trap that can bind one in self-doubt and loathing.

### Denizens

- **Mirror Wraiths**: Shadowy figures that emerge from the mirrors, embodying the envy of past visitors. They are adept at whispering words that fuel discontent and rivalry, making the mirrors even more potent.
- **The Reflective Ones**: Souls trapped within the mirrors, living out their desires in illusory worlds. They occasionally reach out to real-world visitors, offering false promises of guidance to achieve what they most envy.
- **The Shattered**: Those who have been broken by the realization of their mirrored lies. They roam the halls, their forms fractured and shifting, warning new visitors of the dangers or spitefully leading them deeper into envy's grasp.

### Other Notable Features

- **Mirrors of Reversal**: Rare mirrors that, instead of amplifying envy, reflect the true value of what the viewer already possesses, offering a path to contentment and escape from the realm. These mirrors are hidden and guarded, as they undermine The Coveter's influence.
- **The Infinite Staircase**: A looping staircase that promises ascension to one's desires with each step taken, yet it leads nowhere, symbolizing the endless pursuit of envy.
- **Whispering Shadows**: Shadows in this realm move with a will of their own, slipping through mirrors into the material world to spread discontent, often marking individuals with a touch that leaves them more susceptible to envy.

### Interaction with the Material World

- **Portals of Jealousy**: Mirrors in the material world that have witnessed acts of intense envy can become portals to The Mirror Halls, pulling those who gaze upon them with jealousy in their hearts into the realm.
- **The Envious Moon**: On nights when the moon reflects a green hue, the veil between the material world and The Mirror Halls thins, allowing the realm's influence to seep through more freely, enhancing feelings of envy and dissatisfaction among people.

The Mirror Halls serve as a haunting exploration of envy's power to distort perception and desire. Visitors are confronted with the parts of themselves that covet what others have, leading them on a journey through a realm where reality is as mutable as desire. The challenge within The Mirror Halls is not just to navigate its deceptive corridors but to emerge with a sense of self uncorrupted by envy, a task far easier said than done.
