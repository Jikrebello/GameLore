### General Layout of The Inferno Crucible

- **The Ember Fields**: Vast plains where the ground cracks and fissures release jets of flame, the earth itself angry and restless. Here, the air shimmers with heat, and the horizon is always blurred by waves of thermal distortion, making navigation treacherous.
- **The Searing Rivers**: Molten channels that cut through the realm, their banks lined with the charred remains of those who attempted to cross and were overcome by their own anger or the river's intense heat. These rivers serve as natural barriers, dividing territories and challenging travelers with their perilous crossings.
- **The Ashen Forests**: Groves of trees petrified by intense heat, their branches heavy with volcanic ash. These forests are home to creatures born of fire and smoke, embodiments of spontaneous and wild wrath that attack without provocation or reason.

### Points of Interest
