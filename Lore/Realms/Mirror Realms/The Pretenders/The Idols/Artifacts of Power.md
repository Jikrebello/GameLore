### Major Artifacts

#### Idol of Greed: The Avarice's Grasping Coffer
- **Description**: A small, unassuming chest made of gold that is warm to the touch. It has the power to duplicate any non-living material placed inside it. However, each time an item is duplicated, the Coffer demands a higher price, not in coin, but in the owner's memories and experiences, starting with the least significant and ending with the most cherished.
- **Curse**: The more the owner uses the Coffer, the more they forget themselves - their past, their loved ones, and eventually, their own identity, transforming into a guardian of treasure they no longer remember acquiring.

#### Idol of Wrath: The Fury's Ember Blade
- **Description**: A sword that blazes with an eternal flame, capable of cutting through any material and igniting anything it touches. Its wielder is granted unparalleled strength and the power to command fire.
- **Curse**: The blade's fire feeds on the anger of its wielder, growing hotter and more uncontrollable with every outburst of rage. Eventually, the wielder becomes unable to distinguish friend from foe, seeing the world only as targets for their fury.

#### Idol of Envy: The Coveter's Mirror
- **Description**: An ornate hand mirror that allows the user to take on the appearance of anyone they envy, granting them access to the lives and abilities of their subjects.
- **Curse**: With each use, the user's true form becomes more grotesque and their original abilities weaken. Moreover, they become invisible to the one they most desire recognition from, losing their identity in the pursuit of others'.

#### Idol of Sloth: The Slumberer's Dreamweave Shawl
- **Description**: A soft, ethereal shawl that grants its wearer the ability to enter a dream state at will, experiencing any fantasy or memory they desire in vivid detail.
- **Curse**: The wearer becomes addicted to the escape, finding reality increasingly dull and unbearable. As they spend more time in the dream state, their physical body weakens, and they become unable to perform even the simplest tasks without immense effort.

#### Idol of Lust: The Tempter's Heartstring Lyre
- **Description**: A beautifully crafted lyre that, when played, can make anyone listening fall deeply in love with the musician, fulfilling their deepest desires for affection and adoration.
- **Curse**: The musician will never know true love, as all affections gained through the lyre's power are artificial. Moreover, they become obsessed with seeking new audiences to bewitch, leaving a trail of broken hearts and empty relationships.

#### Idol of Pride: The Sovereign's Crown of Echoes
- **Description**: A stunning crown that amplifies the wearer's presence, making them appear more formidable, authoritative, and charismatic to all who lay eyes upon them.
- **Curse**: The crown also amplifies the wearer's pride, causing them to become increasingly arrogant and detached from reality. They hear only praise and agreement, rendering them unable to perceive dissent or danger, leading to their downfall.

#### Idol of Gluttony: The Devourer's Horn of Plenty
- **Description**: A magnificent horn that, when sounded, produces an endless supply of food and drink, capable of feeding an army or filling a banquet hall.
- **Curse**: The food and drink, while initially satisfying, soon become insipid, and other sources of nourishment lose their flavor entirely. The user becomes obsessed with finding new tastes, never satisfied, and is eventually consumed by their own insatiable hunger, unable to find pleasure in anything.

Each artifact not only serves as a testament to the power and peril of their respective sins but also provides a vehicle for stories of characters who must navigate the temptations and trials these objects embody. Through these artifacts, the influence of the Idols can be felt directly in the material realm, setting the stage for epic quests, moral dilemmas, and the eternal struggle between ambition and restraint.

Certainly! Minor artifacts tied to each Idol can add depth to your world, offering a wider array of magical items that are potent and rare, yet not as singularly powerful or curse-laden as the major artifacts. These items can still embody the essence of the Idols, providing both benefits and drawbacks to their users, though on a smaller scale.

### Minor Artifacts of the Idols

#### Idol of Greed: Coin of the Covetous
- **Description**: A golden coin that always returns to its owner's purse after being spent. It grants financial prosperity but makes the owner increasingly miserly and distrustful of others, fearing to lose their wealth.

#### Idol of Wrath: Bracers of the Berserker
- **Description**: Arm bracers that boost the wearer's physical strength during combat. The more the wearer fights, the stronger they become, but they also become more prone to fits of uncontrollable rage outside of battle.

#### Idol of Envy: Whispering Pendant
- **Description**: A pendant that allows the wearer to hear whispers of praise or criticism about themselves when in the presence of others. It fuels ambition but also sows seeds of jealousy and paranoia, as the wearer becomes obsessed with surpassing their perceived rivals.

#### Idol of Sloth: Sandman's Cloak
- **Description**: A cloak that grants restful sleep and pleasant dreams to its wearer, no matter the circumstances. However, the wearer may find themselves sleeping longer and more frequently, struggling to stay awake and losing interest in daily activities.

#### Idol of Lust: Siren's Ring
- **Description**: A ring that enhances the wearer's charm and attractiveness, making them more persuasive in social situations. The ring, however, can cause the wearer and those they enchant to become overly obsessed with superficial beauty, neglecting deeper connections.

#### Idol of Pride: Medal of the Vainglorious
- **Description**: A medal that, when worn, magnifies the wearer's achievements in their own eyes and the eyes of those around them. It boosts confidence but can lead to overestimation of one's abilities and dismissal of others' contributions and warnings.

#### Idol of Gluttony: Everfill Goblet
- **Description**: A goblet that refills with the drinker's beverage of choice, never emptying. It ensures the user never thirsts but can induce a lack of satisfaction with any other food or drink, leading to a constant desire for more exotic and satisfying flavors.

### Integrating Minor Artifacts
These minor artifacts offer a way to bring the influence of the Idols into the hands of more characters within your world, allowing for a broader exploration of themes related to the seven sins. They can serve as rewards, plot devices, or catalysts for character development, presenting both advantages and moral quandaries for those who possess them. Unlike the major artifacts, the effects of these items are more subtle, making them suitable for characters who might not be central to the main narrative but still play significant roles in the unfolding story.
