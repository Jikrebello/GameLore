### General Layout of The Gilded Maze

- **Entrance Hall of Temptations**: The grandiose gateway into the maze, lined with statues of past visitors turned into gold, each holding out tempting treasures to newcomers. This hall sets the tone, showing the riches within and the fate of those who succumb to their greed.
- **Corridors of False Promises**: These ever-changing hallways are lined with gold and precious gems that glitter enticingly but turn to dust when touched. The walls are etched with tales of legendary wealth, each story leading the reader deeper into the maze.
- **Vaults of Echoing Despair**: Hidden throughout the maze, these vaults contain real treasures but are guarded by spectral entities that recount the tragic tales of those treasures' original owners, serving as a grim reminder of greed's cost.

### Points of Interest

- **The Mirrored Market**: A bazaar that reflects the desires of those who enter, offering them exactly what they most crave—for a price. The currency here is not gold but memories, years of life, or slices of the soul's essence.
	- Certain stalls and vendors specialize in games of chance, offering visitors opportunities to "win" their desires. Each game, however, is a gamble not just of wealth but of one's essence, with stakes much higher than they seem.
- **The Garden of Gilt**: A surreal garden where plants are made of precious metals and gemstone fruits hang from the branches. Eating from this garden offers a taste of incredible wealth but at the cost of an insatiable hunger for more.
	- Sections of this garden transform at night into arenas for high-stakes games among the gold-leafed hedges. These games range from riddles to contests of luck, with participants wagering years of life or cherished memories for the promise of immense wealth.
- **The Fountain of Fortunes**: A golden fountain that promises to multiply wealth thrown into its waters. However, the more wealth one sacrifices, the more their greed grows, eventually leading to financial ruin in the real world.
	- Visitors are invited to throw in their most valued possessions or intangible assets (like talents or loved ones' safety) to attempt to multiply them. The fountain's whims determine if the visitor's wealth will increase tenfold or if they'll lose everything, including what they hold dear.

#### The Casino of the Cursed Coin
- **Description**: Nestled within the heart of the maze, this dazzling casino offers every game imaginable, from cards to dice to roulette, each table glittering with gold and gems. The twist? The games are played with cursed coins that bind the player's fate to the outcome. Winning could grant unimaginable wealth, but losing could mean forfeiting one's luck forever or becoming part of the casino's attractions.
    
- **Denizens**: Operated by the spectral bankers and cursed accountants, the casino also employs the Goldbound as dealers and attendants, their hollow eyes watching every play. The air is thick with the excitement of gamblers, spirits who lost everything but still cling to the hope of winning it all back.
    
- **Special Feature**: The High Roller's Room, where the stakes are beyond mortal comprehension. Entry is by invitation only, typically extended to those who have won—or lost—enormously in the main casino. Here, the games can offer dominion over entire realms or trap the player in a gold coin for eternity.

### Denizens

- **Spectral Bankers**: Ghostly figures that manage the transactions within the maze, always ready to offer a loan of gold that will bind the borrower to the maze forever.
- **Cursed Accountants**: Entities tasked with calculating the cost of each visitor's journey through the maze, ensuring that the price paid in the end is always far more than what was gained.
- **The Goldbound**: The tragic figures of past visitors who became part of the maze's decoration, trapped in golden statues, serving as both warning and lure to new arrivals. They occasionally whisper advice or warnings to those who pass by.

### Other Notable Features

- **Traps of Avarice**: Cleverly hidden traps that ensnare those who show the slightest hint of greed, from floors that collapse under the weight of gold to walls that close in on treasure seekers.
- **Echoing Whispers**: The very air of the maze is filled with whispers that promise great wealth, guiding visitors deeper into its confines. These whispers are the voices of The Goldbound, sometimes offering help but more often leading one astray.
- **The Throne of Midas**: The heart of the maze, where the Idol of Greed, "[[The Avarice]]", is said to reside. The throne is rumored to grant unimaginable wealth to those who find it but at the ultimate price—transformation into the next guardian of the maze, forever bound to its gilded corridors.

### Interaction with the Material World

- **Portals of Greed**: Small, hidden portals that appear in the material world, especially in places of great wealth or during transactions of significant greed. These portals lure in the greedy, adding them to the maze's collection of souls.
- **The Lure of the Lost**: Artifacts from the maze sometimes find their way into the material world, beckoning new victims to seek out the maze in hopes of finding matching treasures.

The Gilded Maze serves as a complex metaphor for the pursuit of wealth and the dangers of letting greed consume one's life. It's a realm of endless riches and eternal entrapment, where every treasure hides a trap, and every gain comes with a loss far greater than what is initially apparent. Visitors to this realm are forced to confront their deepest desires and the lengths they are willing to go to fulfill them, often finding themselves ensnared by the very wealth they seek to possess.
