### General Layout of The Banquet Endless

- **The Feast of Foulness**: At the realm's core lies a grand banquet hall where the tables groan under the weight of rotten, putrescent fare and dishes made from the most repulsive ingredients imaginable, including excrement. The air is thick with the stench of decay, yet the seats are never empty, filled with those who have lost all discernment in their quest for new tastes.
- **The Grove of Ghoulish Delights**: A twisted orchard where the trees bear fruit that resembles the heads of various races, each bite releasing screams of agony. The ground is fertile with the compost of corpses, and the fruit, when consumed, imparts memories of the deceased's final moments.
- **Carnal Caverns**: Underground networks where the walls themselves are made of flesh, pulsing and warm. Here, the most forbidden meats are harvested, and cannibalistic feasts are held in dark, blood-soaked grottoes, celebrating the consumption of sentient life as the pinnacle of culinary experience.

### Points of Interest

- **The Pit of Desolation**: A deep chasm where diners throw the remnants of their unspeakable meals. Those who gaze into its depths see visions of the realm's future, where all is consumed, and nothing remains but hunger. It's rumored that the pit holds a portal to a place of pure emptiness, the ultimate end of all gluttony.
- **The Market of Malediction**: A bazaar where traders sell ingredients banned in all civilized lands, from cursed spices that cause eternal hunger to the preserved flesh of extinct creatures. The market's center is a stage for live demonstrations of cooking techniques involving self-mutilation and cannibalism.
- **The Hall of Mirrors**: Updated to reflect the realm's darkest aspect, it now shows diners feasting upon their own bodies or those of loved ones, a mirror to their soul's depravity. Yet, the reflection also offers a glimpse of redemption, if one can turn away from the feast.

### Denizens

- **Feasters of the Forbidden**: Once mortals, now transformed by their unspeakable diets into beings that can only sustain themselves on the flesh of their kind or the vilest of foods. They are both pitied and feared, as their presence is a reminder of the banquet's endgame.
- **The Rotten Hosts**: Ghostly figures that serve the endless banquet, their bodies bloated and decayed, yet eternally bound to their roles. They whisper invitations to partake in the most forbidden dishes, promising euphoria in the consumption of the abominable.
- **The Gourmands of the Ghoulish**: Elite members of the realm's society, who have tasted everything the banquet has to offer and now seek the ultimate culinary taboo: eating the living or consuming one's own flesh in a twisted quest for self-consumption.

### Other Notable Features

- **The Fountain of Filth**: A vile pool that vomits forth an endless supply of sludge, said to be the remnants of the realm's meals. Drinking from it is said to grant visions of the most forbidden feasts, but at the cost of one's sanity.
- **The Banquet's Heart**: A massive, pulsing organ buried beneath the feast halls, feeding the realm with its endless hunger. It's both the source of the banquet's bounty and its curse, compelling all within to partake in its never-ending feast of horrors.
- **Whispers of Waste**: The very air in the realm carries the temptation to indulge in its darkest offerings, with whispers that erode willpower and moral fortitude, urging diners to abandon themselves to the banquet's depravity.

### Interaction with the Material World

- **Portals of Perversion**: Appear in places of starvation or excess, doorways formed from the collective despair and depravity of those nearby, drawing in the desperate and the decadent alike.
- **Echoes of Excess**: Nightmares of the banquet's feasts infiltrate the dreams of the susceptible, implanting an insatiable hunger for the forbidden, slowly eroding their resistance to the realm's call.

The Banquet Endless becomes a dark reflection of the ultimate consequences of gluttony, where the quest for culinary experience pushes beyond the limits of morality into realms of horror and madness. It stands as a cautionary tale, a grotesque monument to the dangers of appetite unchecked and desires unbound.
