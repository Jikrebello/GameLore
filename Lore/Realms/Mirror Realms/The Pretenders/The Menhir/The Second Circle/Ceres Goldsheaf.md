- **Ceres Goldsheaf (Constellation of Harvest)**
    - **Tragic Tale**: Ceres's nurturing nature led her to overextend her powers in an attempt to bring perpetual harvest. This imbalance caused a great celestial famine, and she was placed among the stars as a reminder of the need for natural cycles.
    - **Tragic Tale**: Ceres, once a nurturer, failed to prevent a great famine. Overcome with grief, she turned into a constellation, her tears thought to bring the rain that nurtures crops.
