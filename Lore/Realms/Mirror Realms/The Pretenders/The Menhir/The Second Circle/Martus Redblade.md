- **Martus Redblade (Constellation of War)**
    - **Tragic Tale**: Martus's aggression once threatened to consume the celestial realm. Aethon and Lunara, in a bid to temper his fiery war spirit, placed him in the sky, where his constant battle is with himself, reflected in the stars.
    - **Tragic Tale**: A great general who could never find peace, Martus was doomed to reflect his inner turmoil in the heavens, constantly reliving his battles.
    - **Fearful Aspect**: When bloodshed and conflict are imminent, Martus's constellation appears to bleed in the night sky, a portent of the violence to come.
