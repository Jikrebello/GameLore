- **Orionar Boldstar (Constellation of Courage)**
	- **Tragic Tale**: Orionar's fiery courage led him to challenge the very boundaries of the sky set by his father, Aethon Solcara. His rebellion ended in sorrow, as he was cast into the heavens, his fiery spirit confined to the stars.
    - **Fearful Aspect**: Orionar's constellation is said to blaze brightest when wars loom, a grim reminder of the cost of unchecked bravery.
