#### Appearance
- **Armor Details**: Autumus Decadus's armor is a masterpiece reflecting the essence of autumn. The auburn and rust colors are interspersed with hues of deep gold and fading green, like a forest transitioning into autumn. Engraved leaves on the armor appear to be caught in a perpetual, gentle descent.
- **Aura**: His presence evokes a sense of gentle melancholy, mixed with the tranquility of autumn. The air around him carries the crisp scent of fallen leaves and the earthiness of a forest preparing for winter.

#### Weapon of Office: The Harvester's Scythe
- **Design**: Named "Twilight's Reap," this scythe is more than a tool of harvest; it's a symbol of the inevitable cycles of life and death. The blade is crafted to resemble a crescent moon, and its handle is inlaid with symbols of the setting sun.
- **Powers**: The scythe is said to be able to cut through the metaphysical, severing the ties of life as easily as it slices through the air. It's a reminder that all things must come to an end, only to begin anew.

#### Mount: The Dusk Steed
- **Description**: Named "Leafhoof," this horse mirrors the essence of autumn in its coat, changing colors like the leaves of a tree. Its mane and tail have a quality reminiscent of falling leaves in a gentle breeze.
- **Abilities**: Leafhoof moves with a quiet grace, almost silent, like the soft landing of leaves on the forest floor. It's said to have a calming effect on those it passes, imparting a sense of peace and readiness for the coming winter.

#### Cultural Significance
- **Autumnal Reflections**: Autumus is not just a symbol of death, but also of reflection and preparation. His arrival encourages people to look back on the year, take stock of their achievements, and prepare for the quieter, introspective winter months.
- **Patron of Harvest**: He is revered during harvest festivals as a guardian who oversees the gathering of crops and the preparation for winter, ensuring that nothing is wasted.

#### Interactions and Influence: The Serenity of Ending
- **Bringer of Completion**: His reign, while a prelude to winter's death, is also a celebration of life’s bounty. He brings a time for communities to come together, share their harvest, and strengthen bonds.
- **Symbol of Transition**: Autumus’s influence is seen in the natural world as animals prepare for hibernation and plants shed their leaves, a necessary transition to conserve energy for the rebirth in spring.

#### Myths and Interactions
- **The Last Leaf**: A myth tells of a tree that held onto its last leaf, refusing to let go. Autumus visited the tree, teaching it the importance of letting go, allowing for new growth in the spring.
- **Autumus’s Twilight Walk**: Another tale speaks of a yearly walk Autumus takes through the forests, touching each tree and plant, signaling them to begin their preparation for winter – a beautiful yet somber procession marking the end of the cycle.

Autumus Decadus, as the Autumn Knight of Death, embodies the beauty and solemnity of endings. His presence in the world is a poignant reminder of the natural cycle of life, the importance of reflection, and the necessity of endings for the sake of new beginnings.
