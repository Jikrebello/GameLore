It glimmers with a cold light, reminiscent of a winter's moon. Wisps of icy vapor trail from her as she moves, reinforcing the chill in the air around her.
- **Aura**: A tangible aura of cold surrounds her, causing frost to form on surfaces nearby. Her very presence seems to lower the temperature, evoking the deep freeze of the heart of winter.

#### Weapon of Office: The Scales of Scarcity

- **Powers**: The scales have the ability to draw sustenance from the land, representing the famine aspect of winter. However, in a balancing act, they can also be used to ration and preserve resources, a crucial aspect of enduring the harsh months.

#### Mount: The Pale Horse of Frost
- **Description**: Hiems's mount, named "Frosthoof," appears as if carved from ice, with breath that frosts the air and hooves that leave trails of rime in their wake.

#### Interactions and Influence: The Harshness and Necessity of Winter
